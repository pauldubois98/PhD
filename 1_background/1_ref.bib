	abstract = { Under physiological conditions, cells receive fate-determining signals from their tissue surroundings, primarily in the form of polypeptide growth factors. Integration of these extracellular signals underlies tissue homeostasis. Although departure from homeostasis and tumor initiation are instigated by oncogenic mutations rather than by growth factors, the latter are the major regulators of all subsequent steps of tumor progression, namely clonal expansion, invasion across tissue barriers, angiogenesis, and colonization of distant niches. Here, we discuss the relevant growth factor families, their roles in tumor biology, as well as the respective downstream signaling pathways. Importantly, cancer-associated activating mutations that impinge on these pathways often relieve, in part, the reliance of tumors on growth factors. On the other hand, growth factors are frequently involved in evolvement of resistance to therapeutic regimens, which extends the roles for polypeptide factors to very late phases of tumor progression and offers opportunities for cancer therapy. }

Radiation therapy technology used in clinical practice has evolved over a long period of time. Various areas of science, such as medical physics, mechanical engineering, and computer engineering, have contributed to the continual development of new devices and techniques. The scope of this review was restricted to two areas; i.e., output energy production and functional development, because it is not possible to include all development processes of this technology due to space limitations. The former includes the technological transition process from the initial technique applied to the first model to the latest technique currently used in a variety of machines. The latter has had a direct effect on treatment outcomes and safety, which changed the paradigm of radiation therapy, leading to new guidelines on dose prescriptions, innovation of dose verification tools, new measurement methods and calculation systems for radiation doses, changes in the criteria for errors, and medical law changes in all countries. Various complex developments are covered in this review. To the best of our knowledge, there have been few reviews on this topic and we consider it very meaningful to provide a review in the festschrift in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the KSMP.},

	abstract = {Tomotherapy is delivery of intensity-modulated, rotational radiation therapy using a fan-beam delivery. The NOMOS (Sewickley, PA) Peacock system is an example of sequential (or serial) tomotherapy that uses a fast-moving, actuator-driven multileaf collimator attached to a conventional C-arm gantry to modulate the beam intensity. In helical tomotherapy, the patient is continuously translated through a ring gantry as the fan beam rotates. The beam delivery geometry is similar to that of helical computed tomography (CT) and requires the use of slip rings to transmit power and data. A ring gantry provides a stable and accurate platform to perform tomographic verification using an unmodulated megavoltage beam. Moreover, megavoltage tomograms have adequate tissue contrast and resolution to provide setup verification. Assuming only translational and rotational offset errors, it is also possible to determine the offsets directly from tomographic projections, avoiding the time-consuming image reconstruction operation. The offsets can be used to modify the leaf delivery pattern to match the beam to the patient's anatomy on each day of a course of treatment. If tomographic representations of the patient are generated, this information can also be used to perform dose reconstruction. In this way, the actual dose distribution delivered can be superimposed onto the tomographic representation of the patient obtained at the time of treatment. The results can be compared with the planned isodose on the planning CT. This comparison may be used as an accurate basis for adaptive radiotherapy whereby the optimized delivery is modified before subsequent fractions. The verification afforded tomotherapy allows more precise conformal therapy. It also enables conformal avoidance radiotherapy, the complement to conformal therapy, for cases in which the tumor volume is ill-defined, but the locations of sensitive structures are adequately determined. A clinical tomotherapy unit is under construction at the University of Wisconsin.},

I was also very intrigued to learn that Silvanus Thompson himself, clearly a broad man of science, had earlier in his career actually applied, albeit unsuccessfully, for a Professorship of Chemistry at University College, Bristol.Your President, in his desire that this lecture should be concerned with radiation-chemical effects on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), clearly had in mind that of all biomolecules, DNA is a prime target as far as the biological effects of ionising radiations are concerned. Indeed, it is in an area such as this that the radiation chemist can make his contribution to radiobiology, by establishing the precise nature of the chemical events induced by ionising radiations in the isolated biomolecules. It should be pointed out, however, that whereas the primary chemical events in the biomolecule will be the same whether these are induced in the isolated state or in the cell, subsequent events can be different in vivo due to the presence of other cellular components, for example, enzymes which may be able to repair certain radiation-induced lesions. This last aspect lies, of course, within the domain of the radiation biochemist.}",

	abstract = {The cellular responses to various form of radiation, including ionizing- and UV-irradiation or exposure to electromagnetic fields is manifested as irreversible and reversible structural and functional changes to cells and cell organelles. Moreover, beside the morphological signs related to cell death, there are several reversible alterations in the structure of different cell organelles. The radiation-induced changes in the supramolecular organization of the membranes, including plasma membrane, and different cell organelle membranes, play a significant role in the development of acute radiation injury. These signs of radiation-induced reversible perturbation biological membranes reflect changes in the organization and/or composition of the glycocalix, modified activity and/or distribution of different membrane domains, including enzymes and binding sites. The observed changes of the cell surface micromorphology and the alteration of intercellular connections are closely related to the reorganization of the cytoskeletal elements in the irradiated cells. The mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi-complex, the lysosomal system have long been considered to be direct intracellular targets of irradiation. The listed morphological alterations of nuclear chromatin (e.g. changes of fine structure, altered number of nucleolar organizing regions and micronuclei, development of chromosome aberrations) may originate from the radiation-induced damage to the supramolecular organization of DNA and/or nucleus specific proteins. These endpoints of radiation effects resulted as direct consequence(s) of absorbed radiation energy, and indirectly altered intra-, intercellular communication or modified signal transduction. Some complementary data suggest that all these effects are not strictly specific to radiation and may be best considered as general stress responses, similar to those observed after application of various injurious agents and treatments to cells. Moreover, they may be equally responsible for direct degradation of supramolecular component of cells, altered signal transduction, or changes in the amount or ratio of any extracellular mediators upon irradiation. Nevertheless, qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of any changes of chromosomes by different techniques (morphological analysis of metaphase chromosomes, fluorescent in situ hybridization, development of micronuclei etc.) are useful biological indicators as well as “biological dosimeters” of radiation injury. It is suggested, that some modern methods such as immunohistochemical detection of different proteins, specific markers of cell organelles and cytoskeleton, inspection of distribution of cell surface charged sites and different membrane domains and application of tracer substances may all be included into protocols for evaluation of cell alterations induced by different types and intensities of radiation.}

The treatment procedure is automated and delivered under user supervision. Throughout treatment the radiosurgical target is continually sensed using a combination of X-ray and optical imaging. The target pose is localized into a common reference frame using a combination of image registration algorithms and precisely calibrated coordinate transformations. A robotic couch, on which the patient is positioned, and a robotic treatment manipulator on which a medical linear accelerator is mounted, are aligned using this localization. Manipulation is achieved by delivering ionizing radiation to the target using a high-energy X-ray beam generated by the linear accelerator. Treatment involves delivery of a large number of nonoverlapping treatment beams, from a noncoplanar workspace, that allows sufficient radiation dose to be delivered to the target while respecting the dose tolerances of surrounding healthy tissues. The radiation dose delivered by each beam is determined by a 2D modulated fluence pattern controlled by variable beam collimation, linac dose control, and robot pointing. Pretreatment planning involves segmenting the target and healthy organ volumes using multimodality medical imaging, and using this to optimize the set of beam directions and the modulated fluence pattern for each beam. This chapter describes the CyberKnife System technology, and its major subsystems, as current in 2019.}
