	abstract = {Abstract Past patterns of cancer disease and future changes in the demographic structure have a major influence on the projected incidences of human malignancies. In Germany, nearly a quarter of men and 20\% of women die of cancer, and it is estimated that in Germany around 51\% men and 43\% women will develop cancer during lifetime. Here, we project the cancer incidence case number as well as the number of deaths for the most common cancers in the German population for the years 2020 and 2030. By 2030, prostate cancer will be the most common malignancy, surpassing breast cancer. Lung cancer will rank third most frequent cancer and will remain the most common cause of cancer-related mortality. Additionally, our projections show a marked increase in liver cancer cases with a continuous rise in liver cancer-related deaths. Finally, we project a constant increase in the incidence of pancreatic cancer. Based on our projections, pancreatic cancer will surpass colorectal and breast cancer to rank as the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in Germany by 2030.},

	abstract = {Advocates for “personalized medicine” tests claim they can reduce health care spending by identifying patients unlikely to benefit from costly treatments. But most tests are imperfect, and so physicians have considerable discretion in how they use the results. We show that when physicians face incentives to provide a treatment, the introduction of an imperfect prognostic test will increase treatment rates. We study the interaction of incentives and information in physicians’ choice between conventional radiotherapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for Medicare patients with breast cancer. IMRT is far more costly. Patients with left-side tumors are more likely to benefit from IMRT, though it is unnecessary for the vast majority of patients. IMRT use is 18 percentage points higher in freestanding clinics, where physician-owners share in the lucrative fees generated by IMRT, than in hospital-based clinics. Patients with left-side tumors are more likely to receive IMRT in both types of clinics. However, IMRT use in patients with right-side tumors (the low benefit group) treated in freestanding clinics is actually higher than use in patients with left-side tumors (high benefit group) treated in hospital-based clinics. Prognostic information affects use but does nothing to counter incentives to overuse IMRT.},

	abstract={In the field of radiotherapy, there is very little scientific data on the management of nonagenarians, especially in patients aged 90 years or more and with head and neck cancer (HNC). We made one of the first retrospective study of the feasibility and safety of radiotherapy in this population with HNC. Records of radiotherapy coming from four health facilities were studied to include all nonagenarian patients with HNC in the last 10 years and who received radiation therapy. We analyzed patient characteristics and primary cancers, as well as objective of the treatment (curative or palliative), efficacy and toxicity. Twenty patients receiving radiotherapy were identified; mean age was 93.2 years (standard deviation 2.8). Treatment was given with curative and palliative intent in 40 and 60 {\%} of cases, respectively. The most common primary tumors were tumors of the salivary glands (30 {\%} of cases), oral cavity tumors (25 {\%} of cases) and thyroid tumors (15 {\%} of cases). Median total prescribed dose was 47.5 Gy (12--70 Gy). Median number of delivered fractions was 18.5 (2--35 fractions). All patients received intensive supportive care during radiotherapy. Toxicities were mild to moderate. Radiotherapy could not be completed for four patients (20 {\%} of cases). One patient developed grade 1--2 delayed toxicities. At the last follow-up, only four patients (20 {\%} of cases) were alive. Cancer was cause of death in most cases. Radiotherapy may be performed for the nonagenarians with HNC. The total dose and fractionation must be adjusted to optimize the tolerance. However, the prognosis remains very poor, cancer being the main cause of death. Research of geriatric vulnerabilities prior to any treatment, in the context of a comprehensive geriatric assessment, is still recommended to select patients for radiotherapy.},

	abstract = {Radiotherapy is an important cornerstone in cancer treatment. Ionizing gamma-irradiation is capable of inducing DNA damage and consequential cell death in a precise and effective manner. In recent years it has become clear, however, that this is not the only relevant mechanism of action. Radiotherapy alters the immune composition of the tumor and influences upregulation of MHC I and cancer-testis antigens, inducing immunogenic cell death and supporting dendritic cell activation. Paradoxically, it also increases the relative ratio of regulatory T cells to CD4+ cells, which hampers an effective immune response. Nevertheless, the overall stimulating influence of irradiation on the immune system has been recognized and illustrated in preclinical studies as well as clinical case reports. There have been several attempts to use radiotherapy as an in situ vaccine. The basic rationale is a synergistic effect of different immune therapies like dendritic cell vaccination and CTLA-4 blockade with irradiation. Changes in the immune phenotype after radiotherapy can facilitate dendritic cell functioning. Immune therapy is also able to overcome the inhibitory pool of regulatory T cells through CTLA-4 inhibition, a weak point of radiotherapy. Although successful in preclinical models, there is still a lot of ground that needs to be covered. The optimal radiation dose is crucial, as well as timing and patient selection. Once these unknown parameters are explored, there is a lot of potential in the powerful combination of local immunization and systemic immune treatments for future novel cancer regimens.},

	abstract = {The IMRT treatment planning process typically follows a path that is based on the manner in which the planner interactively adjusts the target and organ-at-risk (OAR) constraints and priorities. The time-intensive nature of this process restricts the planner from fully understanding the dose trade-off between structures, making it unlikely that the resulting plan fully exploits the extent to which dose can be redistributed between anatomical structures. Multiobjective Pareto optimization has been used in the past to enable the planner to more thoroughly explore alternatives in dose trade-off by combining pre-generated Pareto optimal solutions in real time, thereby potentially tailoring a plan more exactly to requirements. However, generating the Pareto optimal solutions can be nonintuitive and computationally time intensive. The author presents an intuitive and fast non-Pareto approach for generating optimization sequences (prior to planning), which can then be rapidly combined by the planner in real time to yield a satisfactory plan. Each optimization sequence incrementally reduces dose to one OAR at a time, starting from the optimization solution where dose to all OARs are reduced with equal priority, until user-specified target coverage limits are violated. The sequences are computationally efficient to generate, since the optimization at each position along a sequence is initiated from the end result of the previous position in the sequence. The pre-generated optimization sequences require no user interaction. In real time, a planner can more or less instantaneously visualize a treatment plan by combining the dose distributions corresponding to user-selected positions along each of the optimization sequences (target coverage is intrinsically maintained in the combination). Interactively varying the selected positions along each of the sequences enables the planner to rapidly understand the nature of dose trade-off between structures and, thereby, arrive at a suitable plan in a short time. This methodology is demonstrated on a prostate cancer case and olfactory neuroblastoma case.},

	abstract = {Electron beam radiotherapy is an accepted method to treat shallow tumors. However, modulation of electrons to customize dose distributions has not readily been achieved. Studies of bolus and tertiary collimation systems have been met with limitations. We pursue the use of photon multi-leaf collimators (MLC) for modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT) to achieve customized distributions for potential clinical use. As commercial planning systems do not support the use of MLC with electrons, planning was conducted using Monte Carlo calculations. Segmented and dynamic modulated delivery of multiple electron segments was configured, calculated and delivered for validation. Delivery of electrons with segmented or dynamic leaf motion was conducted. A phantom possessing an idealized stepped target was planned and optimized with subsequent validation by measurements. Finally, clinical treatment plans were conducted for post-mastectomy and cutaneous lymphoma of the scalp using forward optimization techniques. Comparison of calculations and measurements was successful with agreement of ±2 percent / 2 mm for the energies, segment sizes, depths tested for delivered segments for the dynamic and segmented delivery. Clinical treatment plans performed provided optimal dose coverage of the target while sparing distal organs at risk. Execution of plans using an anthropomorphic phantom to ensure safe and efficient delivery was conducted. Our study validates that MERT is not only possible using the photon MLC, but the efficient and safe delivery inherent with the dynamic delivery provides an ideal technique for shallow tumor treatment.}

	To assess the effect of dose sculpting intensity modulated radiation therapy on vertebral body growth in children with neuroblastoma.
	Methods and Materials
	From 2000 to 2011, 88 children with neuroblastoma underwent radiation at the authors' institution. Children with paravertebral tumors with at least 3 years of evaluable posttreatment imaging were included, and children who underwent spine reirradiation before follow-up were excluded. If vertebral bodies could not be spared, these “target” vertebral bodies were treated to at least 18 Gy. Thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies were assessed separately. Dose data for target, spared, and internal control vertebral bodies were extracted. Multivariate generalized estimating equation modeling was used to assess the effect of dose and other clinical factors on vertebral body growth.
	Results
	A total of 34 patients (20 boys, 14 girls) met study criteria. Median age at start of radiation was 4.3 years; all but 1 had prior high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. Mean growth rates of target, spared, and control vertebral bodies (cm/body/y) were, respectively, 0.027, 0.032, and 0.044 in thoracic spine and 0.033, 0.055, and 0.083 in lumbar spine. On multivariate generalized estimating equation analysis, higher dose, older treatment age, male gender, and thoracic spine location were significantly associated with decreased vertebral body growth (P<.0001, P<.0001, P=.007, and P<.0001, respectively). Dose and spine location were significant in a 3-way interaction model (P<.0001).
	Conclusions
	Vertebral bodies spared by intensity modulated radiation therapy grew faster than target vertebrae. Regardless of intent to spare or target, multivariate analysis confirms that lower dose results in significantly increased growth rate. This technique should be investigated prospectively.}

	abstract = {The goal of radiation therapy is to administer a therapeutic dose of radiation to a target while limiting the side effects caused by delivering the dose to surrounding tissues and vital organs. The ongoing pursuit to achieve an optimal dose distribution has prompted the radiation therapy profession to develop new techniques that incorporate advances in technology. In radiation therapy today, modern techniques that include three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) are routinely used in the treatment of cancers. Compared with 3D-CRT, IMRT is capable of producing dose distributions that conform to the planning treatment volume and deliver a reduced dose to surrounding tissues and vital organs. This has come with the cost of increased treatment time and a larger volume of normal tissue receiving low radiation doses. Most recently, there has been considerable interest in the rotating gantry IMRT techniques, tomotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Tomotherapy is a dedicated treatment system that is best described as a combination of a computed tomography scanner and a linear accelerator. In tomotherapy, treatment is delivered using a rotating fan beam. A therapeutic dose is delivered when a patient is translated smoothly through the bore of the machine as its gantry continuously rotates. Tomotherapy is capable of producing high-quality plans that increasingly spare dose to surrounding organs at risk. In VMAT, treatment is delivered on a linear accelerator using a cone beam that rotates around the patient. The cone beam is modulated by dynamic multileaf collimation, variable dose rate and variable gantry speed to generate IMRT-quality dose distributions in a single optimized arc around the patient. VMAT treatments can significantly reduce the time and monitor units required to deliver a patient’s treatment. Conventional IMRT, tomotherapy and VMAT typically produce dose distributions of similar quality. Which technique is most suited to treat a patient will depend on considerations such as the availability of the specific treatment type and its impact on the utilization of departmental planning and treatment resources.
	Résumé
	Sous l’impulsion principale des avancées technologiques, la radiothérapie a progressé à un point tel que la radiothérapie conformale 3D (3DCRT) et la radiothérapie à modulation de (IMRT) sont utilisées couramment dans le traitement du cancer. Comparativement à la 3DCRT, l’IMRT conventionnelle permet de produire une distribution de dose conforme au PTV et une dose réduite aux tissus et aux organes environnants. Ceci s’est toutefois accompagné d’une augmentation de la durée des traitements et d’un plus grand volume de tissus normaux recevant de faibles doses de rayonnement. Récemment, les techniques IMRT utilisant un portique rotatif, la tomothérapie et l’irradiation dynamique VMAT ont suscité beaucoup d’intérêt. La tomothérapie fait appel à un système spécialisé qu’on peu décrire comme une combinaison d’unité de tomodensitométrie et d’accélérateur linéaire. En tomothérapie, la dose est administrée à l’aide d’un faisceau à cône rotatif. La dose thérapeutique est administrée pendant que le patient est lentement déplacé par l’ouverture de la machine et que le portique tourne. La tomothérapie permet de produire des plans de grande qualité tout en épargnant de plus en plus les organes à risque environnants. Le cône de rayonnement est modulé par MLC dynamique, taux de dose variable et vitesse variable du portique de manière à produire des distributions de dose de qualité IMRT dans un arc optimisé unique autour du patient. Les traitements VMAT peuvent diminuer de façon marquée le temps et les unités de surveillance requises pour assurer le traitement du patient. L’IMRT conventionnelle, la tomothérapie et l’irradiation dynamique VMAT produisent habituellement des distributions de dose de qualité similaires. La technique la plus appropriée pour un patient dépend de considérations comme la disponibilité d’un type particulier de traitement et son effet sur l’utilisation des ressources de planification et de traitement du service.}

	To quantify differences in treatment delivery efficiency and dosimetry between step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and helical tomotherapy (HT) for prostate treatment.
	Methods and Materials
	Twenty-five prostate cancer patients were selected retrospectively for this planning study. Treatment plans were generated for: prostate alone (n = 5), prostate + seminal vesicles (n = 5), prostate + seminal vesicles + pelvic lymph nodes (n = 5), prostate bed (n = 5), and prostate bed + pelvic lymph nodes (n = 5). Target coverage, dose homogeneity, integral dose, monitor units (MU), and sparing of organs at risk (OAR) were compared across techniques. Time required to deliver each plan was measured.
	Results
	The dosimetric quality of IMRT, VMAT, and HT plans were comparable for target coverage (planning target volume V95%, clinical target volume V100% all >98.7%) and sparing of organs at risk (OAR) for all treatment groups. Although HT resulted in a slightly higher integral dose and mean doses to the OAR, it yielded a lower maximum dose to all OAR examined. VMAT resulted in reductions in treatment times over IMRT (mean = 75%) and HT (mean = 70%). VMAT required 15–38% fewer monitor units than IMRT over all treatment volumes, with the reduction per fraction ranging from 100–423 MU from the smallest to largest volumes.
	Conclusions
	VMAT improves efficiency of delivery for equivalent dosimetric quality as IMRT and HT across various prostate cancer treatment volumes in the intact and postoperative settings.}

The complexity of modern radiotherapy techniques and equipment, including computer-controlled treatment machines and treatment management systems, as well as sophisticated treatment techniques that involve intensity-modulated radiation therapy, image-guided radiation therapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy, volumetric modulated arc therapy, respiratory gating, and others, leads to concern about safety issues related to that complexity. This article illustrates the relationship between complexity and computer control, and various safety problems and errors that have been reported, and describes studies that address the issue of these modern techniques and whether their complexity does, in fact, result in more errors or safety-related problems. Clinical implications of these results are discussed, as are some of the ways in which the field should respond to the ongoing concerns about errors and complexity in radiation therapy.}

	abstract = "{Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a widely accepted method for radiation treatment to provide a prescribed and uniform dose to the target volume and a minimum dose to normal tissues that is dependent on the IMRT software and the treatment machine. We examined the variation in IMRT dose prescription, treatment planning, dose recording, and dose delivery among cancer patients who were treated with different treatment planning systems at different medical institutions to assess variability in patient care.We conducted a retrospective analysis of 803 patients who were treated with IMRT between October 2004 and July 2006 for brain, head and neck, or prostate cancer at five medical institutions that used different treatment planning systems. The prescribed dose to the target volume, as recorded in the chart or as noted in the electronic data management system, was extracted for each patient. The planned dose that was delivered to the patient, as represented in the dose–volume histogram, was acquired from each treatment planning system. The actual minimum, maximum, median, and isocenter doses to the target volume were normalized to the prescribed dose and analyzed for each disease site and institution.Of the 803 patients, 12\% were treated for brain cancer, 26\% for head and neck cancer, and 62\% for prostate cancer. The recorded dose variability from prescription was widespread for the minimum, maximum, and isocenter doses. A total of 46\% of the patients received a maximum dose that was more than 10\% higher than the prescribed dose, and 63\% of the patients received a dose that was more than 10\% lower than the prescribed dose. At all five institutions, the prostate cancer cases had the smallest dosimetric variation and the head and neck cancer cases had the largest variation. The median dose to the target varied from the prescribed dose by ±2\% in 68\% of the patients, by ±5\% in 88\% of the patients, and by ±10\% in 96\% of the patients. The recorded isocenter dose varied from prescription for all disease sites and treatment planning systems.Substantial variation in the prescribed and delivered doses exists among medical institutions, raising concerns about the validity of comparing clinical outcomes for IMRT. The isocenter dose in IMRT is simply a point dose and often does not reflect the prescription dose that is specified by a selected isodose line encompassing the target volume. This study suggests the need for national and/or international guidelines for dose prescription, planning, and reporting for a meaningful clinical trial in IMRT.}",

	abstract = {Summary A multicentre planning study comparing intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans for the treatment of a head and neck cancer has been carried out. Three Australian radiotherapy centres, each with a different planning system, were supplied a fully contoured CT dataset and requested to generate an IMRT plan in accordance with the requirements of an IMRT-based radiation therapy oncology group clinical trial. Plan analysis was carried out using software developed specifically for reviewing multicentre clinical trial data. Two out of the three plans failed to meet the prescription requirements with one misinterpreting the prescription and the third failed to meet one of the constraints. Only one plan achieved all of the dose objectives for the critical structures and normal tissues. Although each centre used very similar planning parameters and beam arrangements the resulting plans were quite different. The subjective interpretation and application of the prescription and planning objectives emphasize one of the many difficulties in carrying out multicentre IMRT planning studies. The treatment prescription protocol in a clinical trial must be both lucid and unequivocally stated to avoid misinterpretation. Australian radiotherapy centres must show that they can produce a quality IMRT plan and that they can adhere to protocols for IMRT planning before using it in a clinical trial.},
