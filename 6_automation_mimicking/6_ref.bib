	abstract  = {PURPOSE: To propose a clinically feasible automatic planning
	solution for external beam intensity-modulated radiotherapy,
	including dose prediction via a deep learning and voxel-based
	optimization strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dose
	distribution of patients was predicted using a U-Net-based deep
	learning network based on the patient's anatomy information. One
	hundred seventeen patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and
	200 patients with rectal cancer were enrolled in this study. For
	NPC cases, 94 cases were included in the training dataset, 13 in
	the validation dataset, and 10 in the testing dataset. For
	rectal cancer cases, 172 cases were included in the training
	set, 18 in the validation set, and 10 in the testing set. A
	voxel-based optimization strategy, ``Voxel,'' was proposed to
	achieve treatment planning optimization by dividing body voxels
	into two parts: inside planning target volumes (PTVs) and
	outside PTVs. Fixed dose-volume objectives were attached to the
	total objective function to realize individualized planning
	intended as the ``hybrid'' optimizing strategy. Automatically
	generated plans were compared with clinically approved plans to
	evaluate clinical gains, according to dosimetric indices and
	dose-volume histograms (DVHs). RESULTS: Similarities were found
	between the DVH of the predicted dose and clinical plan,
	although significant differences were found in some organs at
	risk. Better organ sparing and suboptimal PTV coverage were
	shown using the voxel strategy; however, the deviations in
	homogeneity indices (HIs) and conformity indices (CIs) of the
	PTV between automatically generated plans and manual plans were
	reduced by the hybrid strategy ([manual plans]/[voxel
	plans[/[hybrid plans]: HI of PTV70 [1.06/1.12/1.02] and CI of
	PTV70 [0.79/0.58/0.76]). The optimization time for each patient
	was within 1 min and included fluence map optimization, leaf
	sequencing, and control point optimization. All the generated
	plans (voxel and hybrid strategy) could be delivered on
	uRT-linac 506c (United Imaging Healthcare, Shanghai, China).
	CONCLUSION: Deliverable plans can be generated by incorporating
	a voxel-based optimization strategy into a commercial treatment
	planning system (TPS). The hybrid optimization method shows the
	benefit and clinical feasibility in generating clinically
	acceptable plans.},

	abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.},
