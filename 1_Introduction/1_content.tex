\section{Introduction to Cancer}

% mention there is lots of research
% mention there's hope to have better treatment
\subsection{what is cancer?}
\subsubsection{Cells proliferating}
\subsubsection{DNA messed up}
\subsubsection{variety of cancer}
\subsubsection{some safe}
 (e.g.: mole/freckle)
\subsubsection{some not safe}
worse make the human die

\subsection{who is concerned?}
more and more ppl
%include demographic figures
\subsection{risk factors}
\subsubsection{environment impacts the probability of getting cancer}
(e.g.: UV exposure)
\subsubsection{living habits as well}
(e.g.: smooking)
\subsubsection{genetic impacts as well (e.g. "cancer gene")}
	
\subsection{possible treatments}
% there main, quick comparison
% say which treatment is mostly used
\subsubsection{surgery}
\subsubsection{RT}
\subsubsection{chemotherapy}
\subsubsection{combination}

\subsection{10 cancer markers}
%cancer is "smart"
\subsubsection{cell proliferation}
\subsubsection{reprogram cellular metabolism}
\subsubsection{stop cell growth arrest}
\subsubsection{evade apoptosis}
\subsubsection{escape immune system}
\subsubsection{ability to undergo a sufficient number of successive cell cycles of growth and division to generate macroscopic tumors}
\subsubsection{create new blog vessels to get nutriments}
\subsubsection{allow cell escape and metastasis formation}
\subsubsection{change cellular response phenotypic via plasticity}
\subsubsection{senescence}
  
\subsubsection{cancer can be considered as a living thing on its own}
\subsubsection{beyond the cellular level, impacting tissues}

\subsection{4 cancer conditions}
\subsubsection{mutation}
\subsubsection{epigenetic reprogramming}
\subsubsection{inflammatory context}
\subsubsection{disruption of microbiota}

\subsection{phases of cancer}
\subsubsection{initiation}
\subsubsection{promotion}
\subsubsection{tumorigenesis + neoangiogenesis}
\subsubsection{evolution (local, regional, metastasis)}

\subsection{cancer classification:}
\subsubsection{tumor, node, mestastasis}
\subsubsection{stages classification:}
\paragraph{stage 0 which corresponds to a so-called in situ tumor}
\paragraph{stage 1 which corresponds to a single, small tumor}
\paragraph{stage 2 which corresponds to a larger local volume}
\paragraph{stage 3 which corresponds to invasion of the lymph nodes or surrounding tissues}
\paragraph{stage 4 which corresponds to a wider extension in the body in the form of metastases}

\subsection{cancer causes}
various reasons why
\paragraph{environment}
\paragraph{inherited mutations}
\paragraph{mistake in DNA copy} 

\subsection{personalized treatments}
\subsubsection{revolution}
\subsubsection{rapid advances}
\subsubsection{help of mathematics}
\subsubsection{help of AI}

\section{Introduction to Mathematical Optimization}

* optimization def: selection of a best element, with regard to some criteria

* in math: more precisely: optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input

* notion of allowed set

* discrete vs continuous optim

* many real-world and theoretical problems may be modeled in continuous general framework. 

* max(f) <=> min(-f) hence only min

* notion of local vs global min

* feasibility\\
* existance

* optim algos\\
  * 1st order\\
    * gradient descent\\
    * line search\\
    * quasi-newton methods\\
  * 2nd order\\
    * newton's method\\
  * 0th order\\
    * brute force\\
    * heuristics\\

* least squares

* multi-objective optimization

\section{Introduction to Artificial Intelligence}

* quick def

* general idea

* common architetures\\
  * FC\\
  * MLP\\
  * CNN\\
  * RNN\\
  * transformers\\

* Machine learning vs Artificial Intelligence vs Deep Learning

* applications

* learning types\\
  * surpervised\\
  * un-supervised\\
  * self-supervised\\
  * reinforcement / semi-supervised\\

* tasks\\
  * classical tasks\\
    * regression\\
    * classification\\
    * partitioning\\
    * dimension reduction\\
  * generative AI\\
    * images => training is difficult\\
    * text\\

* recent progress\\
  * computer vision\\
  * playing games (a way to assess intelligence)\\
  * image generation\\
  * text generation\\
