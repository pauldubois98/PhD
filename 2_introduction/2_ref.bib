	abstract = {Abstract Past patterns of cancer disease and future changes in the demographic structure have a major influence on the projected incidences of human malignancies. In Germany, nearly a quarter of men and 20\% of women die of cancer, and it is estimated that in Germany around 51\% men and 43\% women will develop cancer during lifetime. Here, we project the cancer incidence case number as well as the number of deaths for the most common cancers in the German population for the years 2020 and 2030. By 2030, prostate cancer will be the most common malignancy, surpassing breast cancer. Lung cancer will rank third most frequent cancer and will remain the most common cause of cancer-related mortality. Additionally, our projections show a marked increase in liver cancer cases with a continuous rise in liver cancer-related deaths. Finally, we project a constant increase in the incidence of pancreatic cancer. Based on our projections, pancreatic cancer will surpass colorectal and breast cancer to rank as the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in Germany by 2030.},

	abstract = "{Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a widely accepted method for radiation treatment to provide a prescribed and uniform dose to the target volume and a minimum dose to normal tissues that is dependent on the IMRT software and the treatment machine. We examined the variation in IMRT dose prescription, treatment planning, dose recording, and dose delivery among cancer patients who were treated with different treatment planning systems at different medical institutions to assess variability in patient care.We conducted a retrospective analysis of 803 patients who were treated with IMRT between October 2004 and July 2006 for brain, head and neck, or prostate cancer at five medical institutions that used different treatment planning systems. The prescribed dose to the target volume, as recorded in the chart or as noted in the electronic data management system, was extracted for each patient. The planned dose that was delivered to the patient, as represented in the dose–volume histogram, was acquired from each treatment planning system. The actual minimum, maximum, median, and isocenter doses to the target volume were normalized to the prescribed dose and analyzed for each disease site and institution.Of the 803 patients, 12\% were treated for brain cancer, 26\% for head and neck cancer, and 62\% for prostate cancer. The recorded dose variability from prescription was widespread for the minimum, maximum, and isocenter doses. A total of 46\% of the patients received a maximum dose that was more than 10\% higher than the prescribed dose, and 63\% of the patients received a dose that was more than 10\% lower than the prescribed dose. At all five institutions, the prostate cancer cases had the smallest dosimetric variation and the head and neck cancer cases had the largest variation. The median dose to the target varied from the prescribed dose by ±2\% in 68\% of the patients, by ±5\% in 88\% of the patients, and by ±10\% in 96\% of the patients. The recorded isocenter dose varied from prescription for all disease sites and treatment planning systems.Substantial variation in the prescribed and delivered doses exists among medical institutions, raising concerns about the validity of comparing clinical outcomes for IMRT. The isocenter dose in IMRT is simply a point dose and often does not reflect the prescription dose that is specified by a selected isodose line encompassing the target volume. This study suggests the need for national and/or international guidelines for dose prescription, planning, and reporting for a meaningful clinical trial in IMRT.}",

	abstract = {Summary A multicentre planning study comparing intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans for the treatment of a head and neck cancer has been carried out. Three Australian radiotherapy centres, each with a different planning system, were supplied a fully contoured CT dataset and requested to generate an IMRT plan in accordance with the requirements of an IMRT-based radiation therapy oncology group clinical trial. Plan analysis was carried out using software developed specifically for reviewing multicentre clinical trial data. Two out of the three plans failed to meet the prescription requirements with one misinterpreting the prescription and the third failed to meet one of the constraints. Only one plan achieved all of the dose objectives for the critical structures and normal tissues. Although each centre used very similar planning parameters and beam arrangements the resulting plans were quite different. The subjective interpretation and application of the prescription and planning objectives emphasize one of the many difficulties in carrying out multicentre IMRT planning studies. The treatment prescription protocol in a clinical trial must be both lucid and unequivocally stated to avoid misinterpretation. Australian radiotherapy centres must show that they can produce a quality IMRT plan and that they can adhere to protocols for IMRT planning before using it in a clinical trial.},
