Integration of these extracellular signals underlies tissue homeostasis. Although departure from homeostasis and tumor initiation are instigated by oncogenic mutations rather than by growth factors, the latter are the major regulators of all subsequent steps of tumor progression, namely clonal expansion, invasion across tissue barriers, angiogenesis, and colonization of distant niches. Here, we discuss the relevant growth factor families, their roles in tumor biology, as well as the respective downstream signaling pathways. Importantly, cancer-associated activating mutations that impinge on these pathways often relieve, in part, the reliance of tumors on growth factors. On the other hand, growth factors are frequently involved in evolvement of resistance to therapeutic regimens, which extends the roles for polypeptide factors to very late phases of tumor progression and offers opportunities for cancer therapy. }

Radiation therapy technology used in clinical practice has evolved over a long period of time. Various areas of science, such as medical physics, mechanical engineering, and computer engineering, have contributed to the continual development of new devices and techniques. The scope of this review was restricted to two areas; i.e., output energy production and functional development, because it is not possible to include all development processes of this technology due to space limitations. The former includes the technological transition process from the initial technique applied to the first model to the latest technique currently used in a variety of machines. The latter has had a direct effect on treatment outcomes and safety, which changed the paradigm of radiation therapy, leading to new guidelines on dose prescriptions, innovation of dose verification tools, new measurement methods and calculation systems for radiation doses, changes in the criteria for errors, and medical law changes in all countries. Various complex developments are covered in this review. To the best of our knowledge, there have been few reviews on this topic and we consider it very meaningful to provide a review in the festschrift in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the KSMP.},

	abstract = {Helical tomotherapy is a dedicated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) system with on-board imaging capability (MVCT) and therefore differs from conventional treatment units. Different design goals resulted in some distinctive radiation field characteristics. The most significant differences in the design are the lack of flattening filter, increased shielding of the collimators, treatment and imaging operation modes and narrow fan beam delivery. Radiation characteristics of the helical tomotherapy system, sensitivity studies of various incident electron beam parameters and radiation safety analyses are presented here. It was determined that the photon beam energy spectrum of helical tomotherapy is similar to that of more conventional radiation treatment units. The two operational modes of the system result in different nominal energies of the incident electron beam with approximately 6 MeV and 3.5 MeV in the treatment and imaging modes, respectively. The off-axis mean energy dependence is much lower than in conventional radiotherapy units with less than 5\% variation across the field, which is the consequence of the absent flattening filter. For the same reason the transverse profile exhibits the characteristic conical shape resulting in a 2-fold increase of the beam intensity in the center. The radiation leakage outside the field was found to be negligible at less than 0.05\% because of the increased shielding of the collimators. At this level the in-field scattering is a dominant source of the radiation outside the field and thus a narrow field treatment does not result in the increased leakage. The sensitivity studies showed increased sensitivity on the incident electron position because of the narrow fan beam delivery and high sensitivity on the incident electron energy, as common to other treatment systems. All in all, it was determined that helical tomotherapy is a system with some unique radiation characteristics, which have been to a large extent optimized for intensity modulated delivery.},

	abstract = {Tomotherapy is delivery of intensity-modulated, rotational radiation therapy using a fan-beam delivery. The NOMOS (Sewickley, PA) Peacock system is an example of sequential (or serial) tomotherapy that uses a fast-moving, actuator-driven multileaf collimator attached to a conventional C-arm gantry to modulate the beam intensity. In helical tomotherapy, the patient is continuously translated through a ring gantry as the fan beam rotates. The beam delivery geometry is similar to that of helical computed tomography (CT) and requires the use of slip rings to transmit power and data. A ring gantry provides a stable and accurate platform to perform tomographic verification using an unmodulated megavoltage beam. Moreover, megavoltage tomograms have adequate tissue contrast and resolution to provide setup verification. Assuming only translational and rotational offset errors, it is also possible to determine the offsets directly from tomographic projections, avoiding the time-consuming image reconstruction operation. The offsets can be used to modify the leaf delivery pattern to match the beam to the patient's anatomy on each day of a course of treatment. If tomographic representations of the patient are generated, this information can also be used to perform dose reconstruction. In this way, the actual dose distribution delivered can be superimposed onto the tomographic representation of the patient obtained at the time of treatment. The results can be compared with the planned isodose on the planning CT. This comparison may be used as an accurate basis for adaptive radiotherapy whereby the optimized delivery is modified before subsequent fractions. The verification afforded tomotherapy allows more precise conformal therapy. It also enables conformal avoidance radiotherapy, the complement to conformal therapy, for cases in which the tumor volume is ill-defined, but the locations of sensitive structures are adequately determined. A clinical tomotherapy unit is under construction at the University of Wisconsin.},

The second purpose is to illuminate the related issue of discrete static beam angles versus rotational techniques, which has recently re-surfaced due to the advancement of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). A specific objective is to find analytical expressions that allow one to address the points raised above. To make the problem mathematically tractable, it is assumed that the depth dose is flat and that the lateral dose profile can be approximated by polynomials, specifically Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, of finite degree. The application of methods known from image reconstruction then allows one to answer the first question above as follows: the required number of beams is determined by the maximum degree of the polynomials used in the approximation of the beam profiles, which is a measure of the dose variability. There is nothing to be gained by using more beams. In realistic cases, in which the variability of the lateral dose profile is restricted in several ways, the required number of beams is of the order of 10–20. The consequence of delivering the beams with a ‘leaf sweep’ technique during continuous rotation of the gantry, as in VMAT, is also derived in an analytical form. The main effect is that the beams fan out, but the effect near the axis of rotation is small. This result can serve as a theoretical justification of VMAT. Overall the analytical derivations in this paper, albeit based on strong simplifications, provide new insights into, and a deeper understanding of, the beam angle problem in IMRT. The decomposition of the beam profiles into well-behaved and easily deliverable smooth functions, such as Chebyshev polynomials, could be of general interest in IMRT treatment planning.}

	abstract = {Abstract Brachytherapy is a specific form of radiotherapy consisting of the precise placement of radioactive sources directly into or next to the tumor. This technique is indicated for patients affected by various types of cancers. It is an optimal tool for delivering very high doses to the tumor focally while minimizing the probability of normal tissue complications. Physicians from a wide range of specialties may be involved in either the referral to or the placement of brachytherapy. Many patients require brachytherapy as either primary treatment or as part of their oncologic care. On the basis of high-level evidence from randomized controlled trials, brachytherapy is mainly indicated: 1) as standard in combination with chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer; 2) in surgically treated patients with uterine endometrial cancer for decreasing the risk of vaginal vault recurrence; 3) in patients with high-risk prostate cancer to perform dose escalation and improve progression-free survival; and 4) in patients with breast cancer as adjuvant, accelerated partial breast irradiation or to boost the tumor bed. In this review, the authors discuss the clinical relevance of brachytherapy with a focus on indications, levels of evidence, and results in the overall context of radiation use for patients with cancer.},

	abstract = { Conformal radiotherapy (CRT) is based on three hypotheses: (i) a higher rate of local control can improve the survival rate; (ii) dose escalation can increase tumor control; and (iii) CRT allows the delivery of higher doses by decreasing the incidence of late effects. These postulates are now supported by several data. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) has markedly progressed since its introduction two decades ago. However, there are situations for which 3D-CRT cannot produce a satisfactory treatment plan because of complex target volume shapes or the close proximity of sensitive normal tissues. This is why intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was introduced. Its aim is to overcome the limitations of 3D-CRT by adding modulators of beam intensity to beam shaping. IMRT can achieve nearly any dose distribution; however, the role of the planner remains crucial. CRT has been investigated mainly for prostate cancers and head and neck cancers. By and large, the clinical data, although still limited, seem to confirm the advantages of this type of radiotherapy. Dose escalation in prostate cancers improves the local control rate without increasing late effects and for this cancer site IMRT appears to be a significant advance over conventional 3D-CRT. In head and neck cancers the clinical data are still scarce but encouraging. CRT should be investigated in breast cancers with the aim of reducing the incidence of late effects. The available data underline the great potential for major progress in 3D-CRT and IMRT. The techniques are still costly and time consuming, nevertheless they merit investigation since their cost should decrease. Efforts should be concentrated on the specification of robust optimization criteria, taking into account clinical and radiobiological data. }

I was also very intrigued to learn that Silvanus Thompson himself, clearly a broad man of science, had earlier in his career actually applied, albeit unsuccessfully, for a Professorship of Chemistry at University College, Bristol.Your President, in his desire that this lecture should be concerned with radiation-chemical effects on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), clearly had in mind that of all biomolecules, DNA is a prime target as far as the biological effects of ionising radiations are concerned. Indeed, it is in an area such as this that the radiation chemist can make his contribution to radiobiology, by establishing the precise nature of the chemical events induced by ionising radiations in the isolated biomolecules. It should be pointed out, however, that whereas the primary chemical events in the biomolecule will be the same whether these are induced in the isolated state or in the cell, subsequent events can be different in vivo due to the presence of other cellular components, for example, enzymes which may be able to repair certain radiation-induced lesions. This last aspect lies, of course, within the domain of the radiation biochemist.},

	abstract = {Purpose
	We performed a comprehensive comparative study of the plan quality between volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for the treatment of prostate cancer.
	Methods and Materials
	Eleven patients with prostate cancer treated at our institution were randomly selected for this study. For each patient, a VMAT plan and a series of IMRT plans using an increasing number of beams (8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 beams) were examined. All plans were generated using our in-house–developed automatic inverse planning (AIP) algorithm. An existing eight-beam clinical IMRT plan, which was used to treat the patient, was used as the reference plan. For each patient, all AIP-generated plans were optimized to achieve the same level of planning target volume (PTV) coverage as the reference plan. Plan quality was evaluated by measuring mean dose to and dose–volume statistics of the organs at risk, especially the rectum, from each type of plan.
	Results
	For the same PTV coverage, the AIP-generated VMAT plans had significantly better plan quality in terms of rectum sparing than the eight-beam clinical and AIP-generated IMRT plans (p < 0.0001). However, the differences between the IMRT and VMAT plans in all the dosimetric indices decreased as the number of beams used in IMRT increased. IMRT plan quality was similar or superior to that of VMAT when the number of beams in IMRT was increased to a certain number, which ranged from 12 to 24 for the set of patients studied. The superior VMAT plan quality resulted in approximately 30% more monitor units than the eight-beam IMRT plans, but the delivery time was still less than 3 min.
	Conclusions
	Considering the superior plan quality as well as the delivery efficiency of VMAT compared with that of IMRT, VMAT may be the preferred modality for treating prostate cancer.}

Some of the earliest investigations of the molecular basis of radiation-induced damage and the implications of enzymatic repair were done by Dr. H. S. Kaplan. The induction frequency of DNA double-strand breaks is of special importance, and it is of interest to know the relative proportions of single-strand and double-strand breaks. This ratio changes noticeably with the radiation quality (ionization density). Because it is difficult to assay for DNA lesions in the large mammalian genome, we have developed a method of assaying for DNA double-strand breaks in the supercoiled nucleosome-complexed Simian virus 40 (SV40) genome, irradiated intracellularly. In this communication we present our measurements of the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to single-strand breaks (SSBs) ratio obtained from the intracellularly irradiated SV40 genome. After cobalt gamma ray and X ray irradiations, this ratio is about 110. Our methods and results are compared with pertinent data in the literature. If the DSBs/SSBs ratio of 110 for cellular chromatin is correct, a substantial number of DNA double-strand breaks are formed in a mammalian cell after moderate doses (1 Gy) of radiation. The implications of different types of DNA double-strand breaks are discussed.}

For 10 patients, a biologically optimized seven-field IMRT plan was compared with a biologically optimized VMAT plan using the same planning objectives. The Pinnacle RTPS was used. The resultant target and organ-at-risk dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were compared. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for the IMRT and VMAT plans was calculated for 3 model parameter sets. The delivery efficiency and time for the IMRT and VMAT plans was compared. The VMAT plans resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the rectal V25Gy parameter of 8.2% on average over the IMRT plans. For one of the NTCP parameter sets, the VMAT plans had a statistically significant lower rectal NTCP. These reductions in rectal dose were achieved using 18.6% fewer monitor units and a delivery time reduction of up to 69%. VMAT plans resulted in reductions in rectal doses for all 10 patients in the study. This was achieved with significant reductions in delivery time and monitor units. Given the target coverage was equivalent, the VMAT plans were superior.}

	ABSTRACT={Thyroid Hürthle cell carcinoma, known as thyroid eosinophilic carcinoma, is a rare pathological type of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), representing 3-4% of all thyroid cancers. However, given the high risk of invasion and metastasis, thyroid Hürthle cell carcinoma has a relatively poor prognosis. Traditional treatment methods have limited effects on patients with metastatic thyroid cancers. Developing a valuable therapy for advanced thyroid carcinomas is an unfilled need, and immunotherapy could represent another choice for these tumors. We herein reported the case of a patient with recurrent advanced thyroid Hürthle cell cancer and positive programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, who suffered tumor progression after re-surgery, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy. It is encouraging that PD-1 inhibitors in combination with GM-CSF and stereotactic body irradiation (SBRT) on metastatic disease have a significant anti-tumor effect.}

	abstract = {Abstract Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a modern radiotherapy modality that uses a multileaf collimator to enable the irradiation of the patient with nonuniform maps of radiation from a set of distinct beam irradiation directions. The aim of IMRT is to eradicate all cancerous cells by irradiating the tumor with a prescribed dose while simultaneously sparing, as much as possible, the neighboring tissues and organs. The optimal choice of beam irradiation directions—beam angle optimization (BAO)—can play an important role in IMRT treatment planning by improving organ sparing and tumor coverage, increasing the treatment plan quality. Typically, the BAO search is guided by the optimal value of the fluence map optimization (FMO)—the problem of obtaining the most appropriate radiation intensities for each beam direction. In this paper, a new score to guide the BAO search is introduced and embedded in a parallel multistart derivative-free optimization framework that is detailed for the extremely challenging continuous BAO problem. For the set of 10 clinical nasopharyngeal tumor cases considered, treatment plans obtained for optimized beam directions clearly outperform the benchmark treatment plans obtained considering equidistant beam directions typically used in clinical practice. Furthermore, treatment plans obtained considering the proposed score clearly improve the quality of the plans resulting from the use of the optimal value of the FMO problem to guide the BAO search.},

For the remainder, effective anti tumor responses may require vaccination. Radiotherapy, traditionally used to achieve local tumor control, has acquired a new role, that of a partner for immunotherapy. Ionizing radiation has pro-inflammatory effects that facilitate tumor rejection. Radiation alters the tumor to enhance the concentration of effector T cells via induction of chemokines, cytokines and adhesion molecules. In parallel, radiation can induce an immunogenic death of cancer cells, promoting cross-presentation of tumor-derived antigens by dendritic cells to T cells. Newly generated anti-tumor immune responses have been demonstrated post-radiation in both murine models and occasional patients, supporting the hypothesis that the irradiated tumor can become an in situ vaccine. It is in this role, that radiation can be applied to induce anti-tumor T cells in lymphocyte-poor tumors, and possibly benefit patients who would otherwise fail to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This review summarizes preclinical and clinical data demonstrating that radiation acts in concert with antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), to induce therapeutically effective anti-tumor T cell responses in tumors otherwise non responsive to anti-CTLA-4 therapy.}

	abstract = {Purpose: To derive limits on the numbers of beams needed to deliver near-optimal IMRT, and to assess the accuracy of the limits. Methods: The authors four different limits have been derived. One, KA, has been obtained by coupling Fourier techniques with a proof used to obtain Bortfeld's limit, K, that if all the cross-profiles of a many-field plan can be represented as polynomials of order (K−1) over the range [−R, + R], then within the radius R circle an identical dose-distribution can be created using just K fields. Two further limits, KH and KN, have been obtained using sampling theory, the KN limit describing fields spaced at the Nyquist frequency. KN can be generalized to KN,Fbeamlet, a limit that accounts for the finite size of the beamlets from which modulated fields are constructed. Using Bortfeld's theoretical framework, the accuracy of the limits has been explored by testing how well the cross-profiles of an 8 MV double-Gaussian pencil beam and of 1 and 4 cm wide fields can be approximated by polynomials of orders equal to the different limits minus one. The dependence of optimized cost function values of IMRT plans, generated for a simple geometry and for a head-and-neck (oropharynx) case, on the numbers of beams used to construct the plans has also been studied. Results: The limits are all multiples of R/W (W being the 20\%–80\% penumbra-width of a broad field) and work out at K = 27, KA = 43, KH = 34, and KN = 68 fields for R = 10 cm and W = 5.3 mm. All and none of the cross-profiles are approximated well by polynomials of order KN−1 and K−1, respectively, suggesting some inaccuracy in the assumptions used to derive the limit K. Order KA−1 polynomials cannot accurately describe the pencil beam profile, but do approximate the 1- and 4-cm profiles reasonably well because higher spatial frequencies are attenuated in these wider fields. All the profiles are represented well by polynomials of order KN,Fbeamlet−1, which decreases from KN as beamlet width increases. Cost functions generated in the IMRT planning study fall as greater numbers of fields are used, before plateauing out around KN,Fbeamlet fields. Conclusions: Numerical calculations suggest that the minimum number of fields required for near-optimal IMRT lies around the generalized Nyquist limit KN,Fbeamlet. For a clinically realistic 20\%–80\% penumbra-width of 5.3 mm and a radius of interest of 10 cm, KN,Fbeamlet falls from 68 to 47 fields as the beamlet width rises from 0 to 1 cm.},

	abstract = {The premise that therapies targeting immune checkpoints can enhance radiation therapy (RT)-induced antitumor immunity is being explored rigorously in the preclinical setting, and early clinical trials testing this hypothesis are beginning to report. Although such approaches might prove efficacious in certain settings, it is likely that many tumor types, particularly those that have a deeply immune-suppressed microenvironment with little or no T cell infiltration, will require alternative approaches. Thus, there is now considerable drive to develop novel immune modulatory therapies that target other areas of the cancer immunity cycle. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed on sentinel immune cells and play a key role in the host defense against invading pathogens. Innate sensing via TLR-mediated detection of pathogen-derived molecular patterns can lead to maturation of antigen-presenting cells and downstream activation of adaptive immunity. After demonstrating promising efficacy in preclinical studies, drugs that stimulate TLR have been approved for use clinically, albeit to a limited extent. There is a growing body of preclinical evidence that novel agonists targeting TLR3, TLR7/8, or TLR9 in combination with RT might lead to enhanced antitumor immunity. Mechanistic studies have revealed that TLR agonists enhance dendritic cell–mediated T cell priming after RT, in some cases leading to the generation of systemic antitumor immunity and immune memory. In this report, we describe results from preclinical studies that advocate the strategy of combining RT with TLR agonists, discuss reported mechanisms of action, and explore the exciting opportunities of how this approach may be successfully translated into clinical practice.}

Of these, the biological significance of DPCs remains elusive. In this article, we focus on radiation-induced DPCs and review the current understanding of their induction, properties, repair, and biological consequences. When cells are irradiated, the formation of base damage, SSBs, and DSBs are promoted in the presence of oxygen. Conversely, that of DPCs is promoted in the absence of oxygen, suggesting their importance in hypoxic cells, such as those present in tumors. DNA and protein radicals generated by hydroxyl radicals (i.e., indirect effect) are responsible for DPC formation. In addition, DPCs can also be formed from guanine radical cations generated by the direct effect. Actin, histones, and other proteins have been identified as cross-linked proteins. Also, covalent linkages between DNA and protein constituents such as thymine–lysine and guanine–lysine have been identified and their structures are proposed. In irradiated cells and tissues, DPCs are repaired in a biphasic manner, consisting of fast and slow components. The half-time for the fast component is 20min–2h and that for the slow component is 2–70h. Notably, radiation-induced DPCs are repaired more slowly than DSBs. Homologous recombination plays a pivotal role in the repair of radiation-induced DPCs as well as DSBs. Recently, a novel mechanism of DPC repair mediated by a DPC protease was reported, wherein the resulting DNA–peptide cross-links were bypassed by translesion synthesis. The replication and transcription of DPC-bearing reporter plasmids are inhibited in cells, suggesting that DPCs are potentially lethal lesions. However, whether DPCs are mutagenic and induce gross chromosomal alterations remains to be determined.}

Moreover, beside the morphological signs related to cell death, there are several reversible alterations in the structure of different cell organelles. The radiation-induced changes in the supramolecular organization of the membranes, including plasma membrane, and different cell organelle membranes, play a significant role in the development of acute radiation injury. These signs of radiation-induced reversible perturbation biological membranes reflect changes in the organization and/or composition of the glycocalix, modified activity and/or distribution of different membrane domains, including enzymes and binding sites. The observed changes of the cell surface micromorphology and the alteration of intercellular connections are closely related to the reorganization of the cytoskeletal elements in the irradiated cells. The mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi-complex, the lysosomal system have long been considered to be direct intracellular targets of irradiation. The listed morphological alterations of nuclear chromatin (e.g. changes of fine structure, altered number of nucleolar organizing regions and micronuclei, development of chromosome aberrations) may originate from the radiation-induced damage to the supramolecular organization of DNA and/or nucleus specific proteins. These endpoints of radiation effects resulted as direct consequence(s) of absorbed radiation energy, and indirectly altered intra-, intercellular communication or modified signal transduction. Some complementary data suggest that all these effects are not strictly specific to radiation and may be best considered as general stress responses, similar to those observed after application of various injurious agents and treatments to cells. Moreover, they may be equally responsible for direct degradation of supramolecular component of cells, altered signal transduction, or changes in the amount or ratio of any extracellular mediators upon irradiation. Nevertheless, qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of any changes of chromosomes by different techniques (morphological analysis of metaphase chromosomes, fluorescent in situ hybridization, development of micronuclei etc.) are useful biological indicators as well as “biological dosimeters” of radiation injury. It is suggested, that some modern methods such as immunohistochemical detection of different proteins, specific markers of cell organelles and cytoskeleton, inspection of distribution of cell surface charged sites and different membrane domains and application of tracer substances may all be included into protocols for evaluation of cell alterations induced by different types and intensities of radiation.}

The treatment procedure is automated and delivered under user supervision. Throughout treatment the radiosurgical target is continually sensed using a combination of X-ray and optical imaging. The target pose is localized into a common reference frame using a combination of image registration algorithms and precisely calibrated coordinate transformations. A robotic couch, on which the patient is positioned, and a robotic treatment manipulator on which a medical linear accelerator is mounted, are aligned using this localization. Manipulation is achieved by delivering ionizing radiation to the target using a high-energy X-ray beam generated by the linear accelerator. Treatment involves delivery of a large number of nonoverlapping treatment beams, from a noncoplanar workspace, that allows sufficient radiation dose to be delivered to the target while respecting the dose tolerances of surrounding healthy tissues. The radiation dose delivered by each beam is determined by a 2D modulated fluence pattern controlled by variable beam collimation, linac dose control, and robot pointing. Pretreatment planning involves segmenting the target and healthy organ volumes using multimodality medical imaging, and using this to optimize the set of beam directions and the modulated fluence pattern for each beam. This chapter describes the CyberKnife System technology, and its major subsystems, as current in 2019.}
