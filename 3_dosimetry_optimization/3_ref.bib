	abstract = { The health effects of low-dose radiation (LDR) have been the concern of the academic spheres, regulatory bodies, governments, and the public. Among these effects, the most important is carcinogenesis. In view of the importance of immune surveillance in cancer control, the dose-response relationship of the changes in different cell types of the immune system after whole-body irradiation is analyzed on the basis of systemic data from the author's laboratory in combination with recent reports in the literature. For T lymphocytes J- or inverted J-shaped curves are usually demonstrated after irradiation, while for macrophages dose-response curves of chiefly stimulation with irregular patterns are often observed. The intercellular reactions between the antigen presenting cell (APC) and T lymphocyte (TLC) in the immunologic synapse via expression of surface molecules and secretion of cytokines by the two cell types after different doses of radiation are illustrated. The different pathways of signal transduction thus facilitated in the T lymphocyte by different doses of radiation are analyzed to explain the mechanism of the phenomenon of low-dose stimulation and high-dose suppression of immunity. Experimental and clinical data are cited to show that LDR retards tumor growth, reduces metastasis, increases the efficacy of conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy as well as alleviates the suppression of immunity due to tumor burden. The incidence of thymic lymphoma after high-dose radiation is lowered by preexposure to low-dose radiation, and its mechanism is supposed to be related to the stimulation of anticancer immunity induced by low-dose radiation. Recent reports on lowering of standardized cancer mortality rate and all cause death rate of cohorts occupationally exposed to low-dose radiation from the US, UK, and Canada are cited. }

	abstract  = "Rapid developments in imaging techniques, including functional imaging, have fueled the drive to implement new methods of delivering three-dimensional radiation therapy, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), with unprecedented accuracy. In comparison with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) it is now possible with IMRT to escalate the absorbed dose in the target volume for the same normal tissue dose and/or to reduce the normal tissue dose for the same tumor dose, resulting in improved tumor control and/or less normal tissue complications. IMRT is accomplished by the sequential isocentric delivery of multiple small beams typically of non-uniform intensity that can lead to the generation of very steep dose gradients. To meet the requirements of such sophisticated beam delivery techniques both tumor and normal tissue volumes must be delineated in 3D with high precision. The use of dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the specification of absorbed dose is inherent to the treatment modality. The demands on treatment planning systems to ensure accurate dose delivery necessitate the employment of complex iterative optimization processes. The stringent requirements on precision for the entire treatment process from imaging to treatment entail the implementation of comprehensive commissioning and quality assurance programs. The present report provides the information necessary to standardize techniques and procedures and to harmonize the prescribing, recording, and reporting of IMRT where possible with those of other modalities. Applicable concepts and recommendations in other ICRU reports concerning radiation therapy are adopted and extended where required. Clinical examples of IMRT are provided to illustrate the recommendations of prescribing, recording, and reporting that are contained in this report. As the present report describes in some detail the physical, technical, treatment planning and clinical aspects of IMRT, it should be a useful reference for current practitioners and should also provide new and potential users, as well as other interested readers, with the basic background to enable them to understand the techniques involved and the requirements for implementing IMRT."
