	abstract = {Purpose To develop a deep learning method to predict patient-specific dose volume histograms (DVHs) for radiotherapy planning. Methods Patient data included 180 cases with nasopharyngeal cancer, of which 153 cases were used for training and 27 for testing. A network (named “DVHnet”) based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed for directly predicting DVHs of organs at risk (OARs). Two-channel images with contoured structures were generated as the inputs for training the model. A one-dimensional array consisting of 256 continuous volume percentages on a DVH curve for each slice was calculated as the corresponding output. The combined DVH was then calculated. Sixteen OARs were modeled in the study. Prediction accuracy was evaluated against the corresponding DVH curve of ground truth (GT) plans. A global DVH analysis and critical dosimetry metrics for each OAR were calculated for quantitative evaluation. The performance of DVHnet also was evaluated against two baselines: DosemapNet (developed by our research group) and commercial RapidPlan software. Results The predicted mean difference in average dose of all OARs using DVHnet was 0.30 ± 0.95 Gy. And the predicted differences in D2\% and D50 can be control within 2.32 and 0.69 Gy. For most OARs, there were no obvious differences between the dosimetric metrics of the predicted and GT values for both DVHnet and DosemapNet (P ≥ 0.05). Only the predicted D2\% of the optic organs for DVHnet, and of brain stem PRV for DosemapNet displayed statistically significant differences. Except for the optic organs, DVHnet performs better than or comparably with RapidPlan. The mean difference in proportion of points of interest was 3.59\% ± 7.78\%. Conclusions A deep learning network model was developed to automatically extract useful features for accurate prediction of patient-specific DVH curves directly. The performance of DVHnet was comparable to DosemapNet and RapidPlan.},

	Zhang, Kang and Wang, Jiazhou and Hu, Weigang},
	abstract  = {PURPOSE: To propose a clinically feasible automatic planning
	solution for external beam intensity-modulated radiotherapy,
	including dose prediction via a deep learning and voxel-based
	optimization strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dose
	distribution of patients was predicted using a U-Net-based deep
	learning network based on the patient's anatomy information. One
	hundred seventeen patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and
	200 patients with rectal cancer were enrolled in this study. For
	NPC cases, 94 cases were included in the training dataset, 13 in
	the validation dataset, and 10 in the testing dataset. For
	rectal cancer cases, 172 cases were included in the training
	set, 18 in the validation set, and 10 in the testing set. A
	voxel-based optimization strategy, ``Voxel,'' was proposed to
	achieve treatment planning optimization by dividing body voxels
	into two parts: inside planning target volumes (PTVs) and
	outside PTVs. Fixed dose-volume objectives were attached to the
	total objective function to realize individualized planning
	intended as the ``hybrid'' optimizing strategy. Automatically
	generated plans were compared with clinically approved plans to
	evaluate clinical gains, according to dosimetric indices and
	dose-volume histograms (DVHs). RESULTS: Similarities were found
	between the DVH of the predicted dose and clinical plan,
	although significant differences were found in some organs at
	risk. Better organ sparing and suboptimal PTV coverage were
	shown using the voxel strategy; however, the deviations in
	homogeneity indices (HIs) and conformity indices (CIs) of the
	PTV between automatically generated plans and manual plans were
	reduced by the hybrid strategy ([manual plans]/[voxel
	plans[/[hybrid plans]: HI of PTV70 [1.06/1.12/1.02] and CI of
	PTV70 [0.79/0.58/0.76]). The optimization time for each patient
	was within 1 min and included fluence map optimization, leaf
	sequencing, and control point optimization. All the generated
	plans (voxel and hybrid strategy) could be delivered on
	uRT-linac 506c (United Imaging Healthcare, Shanghai, China).
	CONCLUSION: Deliverable plans can be generated by incorporating
	a voxel-based optimization strategy into a commercial treatment
	planning system (TPS). The hybrid optimization method shows the
	benefit and clinical feasibility in generating clinically
	acceptable plans.},

	abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.},

	abstract = {Attention has arguably become one of the most important concepts in the deep learning field. It is inspired by the biological systems of humans that tend to focus on the distinctive parts when processing large amounts of information. With the development of deep neural networks, attention mechanism has been widely used in diverse application domains. This paper aims to give an overview of the state-of-the-art attention models proposed in recent years. Toward a better general understanding of attention mechanisms, we define a unified model that is suitable for most attention structures. Each step of the attention mechanism implemented in the model is described in detail. Furthermore, we classify existing attention models according to four criteria: the softness of attention, forms of input feature, input representation, and output representation. Besides, we summarize network architectures used in conjunction with the attention mechanism and describe some typical applications of attention mechanism. Finally, we discuss the interpretability that attention brings to deep learning and present its potential future trends.}

	abstract = {Purpose: While deep learning has shown promise for automated
	radiotherapy planning, its application to the specific scenario
	of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases using
	fixed-field intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) on a
	linear accelerator remains limited. This work aimed to develop
	and verify a deep learning-guided automated planning protocol
	tailored for this scenario. Methods: We collected 70 SRS plans
	for solitary brain metastases, of which 36 cases were for
	training and 34 for testing. Test cases were derived from two
	distinct clinical institutions. The envisioned automated planning
	process comprised (1): clinical dose prediction facilitated by
	deep-learning algorithms (2); transformation of the forecasted
	dose into executable plans via voxel-centric dose emulation (3);
	validation of the envisaged plan employing a precise dosimeter in
	conjunction with a linear accelerator. Dose prediction paradigms
	were established by engineering and refining two
	three-dimensional UNet architectures (UNet and AttUNet). Input
	parameters encompassed computed tomography scans from clinical
	plans and demarcations of the focal point alongside organs at
	potential risk (OARs); the ensuing output manifested as a 3D dose
	matrix tailored for each case under scrutiny. Results: Dose
	estimations rendered by both models mirrored the manual plans and
	adhered to clinical stipulations. As projected by the dual
	models, the apex and average doses for OARs did not deviate
	appreciably from those delineated in the manual plan
	(P-value$\geq$0.05). AttUNet showed promising results compared to
	the foundational UNet. Predicted doses showcased a pronounced
	dose gradient, with peak concentrations localized within the
	target vicinity. The executable plans conformed to clinical
	dosimetric benchmarks and aligned with their associated
	verification assessments (100\% gamma approval rate at 3 mm/3\%).
	Conclusion: This study demonstrates an automated planning
	technique for fixed-field IMRT-based SRS for brain metastases.
	The envisaged plans met clinical requirements, were reproducible
	across centers, and achievable in deliveries. This represents
	progress toward automated paradigms for this specific scenario.},
