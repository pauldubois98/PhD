This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape in radiotherapy planning.
We begin by re-contextualizing the field and outlining the critical challenges and limitations traditional methods face.
The state of the art is then explored, detailing advancements in automated rule implementation, knowledge-based radiotherapy planning, and Multi-Criteria Optimization (MCO).
We address the pivotal role of automated and knowledge-based techniques in improving treatment efficiency.
The commercial solutions, such as Pinnacle AutoPlanning, Eclipse RapidPlan, and RayStation are discussed.
We identify unresolved problems within the field, setting the stage for the subsequent sections of the thesis.
