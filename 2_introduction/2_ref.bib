	abstract = {Abstract Past patterns of cancer disease and future changes in the demographic structure have a major influence on the projected incidences of human malignancies. In Germany, nearly a quarter of men and 20\% of women die of cancer, and it is estimated that in Germany around 51\% men and 43\% women will develop cancer during lifetime. Here, we project the cancer incidence case number as well as the number of deaths for the most common cancers in the German population for the years 2020 and 2030. By 2030, prostate cancer will be the most common malignancy, surpassing breast cancer. Lung cancer will rank third most frequent cancer and will remain the most common cause of cancer-related mortality. Additionally, our projections show a marked increase in liver cancer cases with a continuous rise in liver cancer-related deaths. Finally, we project a constant increase in the incidence of pancreatic cancer. Based on our projections, pancreatic cancer will surpass colorectal and breast cancer to rank as the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in Germany by 2030.},

	abstract = {Advocates for “personalized medicine” tests claim they can reduce health care spending by identifying patients unlikely to benefit from costly treatments. But most tests are imperfect, and so physicians have considerable discretion in how they use the results. We show that when physicians face incentives to provide a treatment, the introduction of an imperfect prognostic test will increase treatment rates. We study the interaction of incentives and information in physicians’ choice between conventional radiotherapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for Medicare patients with breast cancer. IMRT is far more costly. Patients with left-side tumors are more likely to benefit from IMRT, though it is unnecessary for the vast majority of patients. IMRT use is 18 percentage points higher in freestanding clinics, where physician-owners share in the lucrative fees generated by IMRT, than in hospital-based clinics. Patients with left-side tumors are more likely to receive IMRT in both types of clinics. However, IMRT use in patients with right-side tumors (the low benefit group) treated in freestanding clinics is actually higher than use in patients with left-side tumors (high benefit group) treated in hospital-based clinics. Prognostic information affects use but does nothing to counter incentives to overuse IMRT.},

	abstract={In the field of radiotherapy, there is very little scientific data on the management of nonagenarians, especially in patients aged 90 years or more and with head and neck cancer (HNC). We made one of the first retrospective study of the feasibility and safety of radiotherapy in this population with HNC. Records of radiotherapy coming from four health facilities were studied to include all nonagenarian patients with HNC in the last 10 years and who received radiation therapy. We analyzed patient characteristics and primary cancers, as well as objective of the treatment (curative or palliative), efficacy and toxicity. Twenty patients receiving radiotherapy were identified; mean age was 93.2 years (standard deviation 2.8). Treatment was given with curative and palliative intent in 40 and 60 {\%} of cases, respectively. The most common primary tumors were tumors of the salivary glands (30 {\%} of cases), oral cavity tumors (25 {\%} of cases) and thyroid tumors (15 {\%} of cases). Median total prescribed dose was 47.5 Gy (12--70 Gy). Median number of delivered fractions was 18.5 (2--35 fractions). All patients received intensive supportive care during radiotherapy. Toxicities were mild to moderate. Radiotherapy could not be completed for four patients (20 {\%} of cases). One patient developed grade 1--2 delayed toxicities. At the last follow-up, only four patients (20 {\%} of cases) were alive. Cancer was cause of death in most cases. Radiotherapy may be performed for the nonagenarians with HNC. The total dose and fractionation must be adjusted to optimize the tolerance. However, the prognosis remains very poor, cancer being the main cause of death. Research of geriatric vulnerabilities prior to any treatment, in the context of a comprehensive geriatric assessment, is still recommended to select patients for radiotherapy.},

	abstract = {Radiotherapy is an important cornerstone in cancer treatment. Ionizing gamma-irradiation is capable of inducing DNA damage and consequential cell death in a precise and effective manner. In recent years it has become clear, however, that this is not the only relevant mechanism of action. Radiotherapy alters the immune composition of the tumor and influences upregulation of MHC I and cancer-testis antigens, inducing immunogenic cell death and supporting dendritic cell activation. Paradoxically, it also increases the relative ratio of regulatory T cells to CD4+ cells, which hampers an effective immune response. Nevertheless, the overall stimulating influence of irradiation on the immune system has been recognized and illustrated in preclinical studies as well as clinical case reports. There have been several attempts to use radiotherapy as an in situ vaccine. The basic rationale is a synergistic effect of different immune therapies like dendritic cell vaccination and CTLA-4 blockade with irradiation. Changes in the immune phenotype after radiotherapy can facilitate dendritic cell functioning. Immune therapy is also able to overcome the inhibitory pool of regulatory T cells through CTLA-4 inhibition, a weak point of radiotherapy. Although successful in preclinical models, there is still a lot of ground that needs to be covered. The optimal radiation dose is crucial, as well as timing and patient selection. Once these unknown parameters are explored, there is a lot of potential in the powerful combination of local immunization and systemic immune treatments for future novel cancer regimens.},

	abstract = {The IMRT treatment planning process typically follows a path that is based on the manner in which the planner interactively adjusts the target and organ-at-risk (OAR) constraints and priorities. The time-intensive nature of this process restricts the planner from fully understanding the dose trade-off between structures, making it unlikely that the resulting plan fully exploits the extent to which dose can be redistributed between anatomical structures. Multiobjective Pareto optimization has been used in the past to enable the planner to more thoroughly explore alternatives in dose trade-off by combining pre-generated Pareto optimal solutions in real time, thereby potentially tailoring a plan more exactly to requirements. However, generating the Pareto optimal solutions can be nonintuitive and computationally time intensive. The author presents an intuitive and fast non-Pareto approach for generating optimization sequences (prior to planning), which can then be rapidly combined by the planner in real time to yield a satisfactory plan. Each optimization sequence incrementally reduces dose to one OAR at a time, starting from the optimization solution where dose to all OARs are reduced with equal priority, until user-specified target coverage limits are violated. The sequences are computationally efficient to generate, since the optimization at each position along a sequence is initiated from the end result of the previous position in the sequence. The pre-generated optimization sequences require no user interaction. In real time, a planner can more or less instantaneously visualize a treatment plan by combining the dose distributions corresponding to user-selected positions along each of the optimization sequences (target coverage is intrinsically maintained in the combination). Interactively varying the selected positions along each of the sequences enables the planner to rapidly understand the nature of dose trade-off between structures and, thereby, arrive at a suitable plan in a short time. This methodology is demonstrated on a prostate cancer case and olfactory neuroblastoma case.},

	abstract = {Electron beam radiotherapy is an accepted method to treat shallow tumors. However, modulation of electrons to customize dose distributions has not readily been achieved. Studies of bolus and tertiary collimation systems have been met with limitations. We pursue the use of photon multi-leaf collimators (MLC) for modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT) to achieve customized distributions for potential clinical use. As commercial planning systems do not support the use of MLC with electrons, planning was conducted using Monte Carlo calculations. Segmented and dynamic modulated delivery of multiple electron segments was configured, calculated and delivered for validation. Delivery of electrons with segmented or dynamic leaf motion was conducted. A phantom possessing an idealized stepped target was planned and optimized with subsequent validation by measurements. Finally, clinical treatment plans were conducted for post-mastectomy and cutaneous lymphoma of the scalp using forward optimization techniques. Comparison of calculations and measurements was successful with agreement of ±2 percent / 2 mm for the energies, segment sizes, depths tested for delivered segments for the dynamic and segmented delivery. Clinical treatment plans performed provided optimal dose coverage of the target while sparing distal organs at risk. Execution of plans using an anthropomorphic phantom to ensure safe and efficient delivery was conducted. Our study validates that MERT is not only possible using the photon MLC, but the efficient and safe delivery inherent with the dynamic delivery provides an ideal technique for shallow tumor treatment.}

	To assess the effect of dose sculpting intensity modulated radiation therapy on vertebral body growth in children with neuroblastoma.
	Methods and Materials
	From 2000 to 2011, 88 children with neuroblastoma underwent radiation at the authors' institution. Children with paravertebral tumors with at least 3 years of evaluable posttreatment imaging were included, and children who underwent spine reirradiation before follow-up were excluded. If vertebral bodies could not be spared, these “target” vertebral bodies were treated to at least 18 Gy. Thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies were assessed separately. Dose data for target, spared, and internal control vertebral bodies were extracted. Multivariate generalized estimating equation modeling was used to assess the effect of dose and other clinical factors on vertebral body growth.
	Results
	A total of 34 patients (20 boys, 14 girls) met study criteria. Median age at start of radiation was 4.3 years; all but 1 had prior high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. Mean growth rates of target, spared, and control vertebral bodies (cm/body/y) were, respectively, 0.027, 0.032, and 0.044 in thoracic spine and 0.033, 0.055, and 0.083 in lumbar spine. On multivariate generalized estimating equation analysis, higher dose, older treatment age, male gender, and thoracic spine location were significantly associated with decreased vertebral body growth (P<.0001, P<.0001, P=.007, and P<.0001, respectively). Dose and spine location were significant in a 3-way interaction model (P<.0001).
	Conclusions
	Vertebral bodies spared by intensity modulated radiation therapy grew faster than target vertebrae. Regardless of intent to spare or target, multivariate analysis confirms that lower dose results in significantly increased growth rate. This technique should be investigated prospectively.}

	abstract = {The goal of radiation therapy is to administer a therapeutic dose of radiation to a target while limiting the side effects caused by delivering the dose to surrounding tissues and vital organs. The ongoing pursuit to achieve an optimal dose distribution has prompted the radiation therapy profession to develop new techniques that incorporate advances in technology. In radiation therapy today, modern techniques that include three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) are routinely used in the treatment of cancers. Compared with 3D-CRT, IMRT is capable of producing dose distributions that conform to the planning treatment volume and deliver a reduced dose to surrounding tissues and vital organs. This has come with the cost of increased treatment time and a larger volume of normal tissue receiving low radiation doses. Most recently, there has been considerable interest in the rotating gantry IMRT techniques, tomotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Tomotherapy is a dedicated treatment system that is best described as a combination of a computed tomography scanner and a linear accelerator. In tomotherapy, treatment is delivered using a rotating fan beam. A therapeutic dose is delivered when a patient is translated smoothly through the bore of the machine as its gantry continuously rotates. Tomotherapy is capable of producing high-quality plans that increasingly spare dose to surrounding organs at risk. In VMAT, treatment is delivered on a linear accelerator using a cone beam that rotates around the patient. The cone beam is modulated by dynamic multileaf collimation, variable dose rate and variable gantry speed to generate IMRT-quality dose distributions in a single optimized arc around the patient. VMAT treatments can significantly reduce the time and monitor units required to deliver a patient’s treatment. Conventional IMRT, tomotherapy and VMAT typically produce dose distributions of similar quality. Which technique is most suited to treat a patient will depend on considerations such as the availability of the specific treatment type and its impact on the utilization of departmental planning and treatment resources.
	Résumé
	Sous l’impulsion principale des avancées technologiques, la radiothérapie a progressé à un point tel que la radiothérapie conformale 3D (3DCRT) et la radiothérapie à modulation de (IMRT) sont utilisées couramment dans le traitement du cancer. Comparativement à la 3DCRT, l’IMRT conventionnelle permet de produire une distribution de dose conforme au PTV et une dose réduite aux tissus et aux organes environnants. Ceci s’est toutefois accompagné d’une augmentation de la durée des traitements et d’un plus grand volume de tissus normaux recevant de faibles doses de rayonnement. Récemment, les techniques IMRT utilisant un portique rotatif, la tomothérapie et l’irradiation dynamique VMAT ont suscité beaucoup d’intérêt. La tomothérapie fait appel à un système spécialisé qu’on peu décrire comme une combinaison d’unité de tomodensitométrie et d’accélérateur linéaire. En tomothérapie, la dose est administrée à l’aide d’un faisceau à cône rotatif. La dose thérapeutique est administrée pendant que le patient est lentement déplacé par l’ouverture de la machine et que le portique tourne. La tomothérapie permet de produire des plans de grande qualité tout en épargnant de plus en plus les organes à risque environnants. Le cône de rayonnement est modulé par MLC dynamique, taux de dose variable et vitesse variable du portique de manière à produire des distributions de dose de qualité IMRT dans un arc optimisé unique autour du patient. Les traitements VMAT peuvent diminuer de façon marquée le temps et les unités de surveillance requises pour assurer le traitement du patient. L’IMRT conventionnelle, la tomothérapie et l’irradiation dynamique VMAT produisent habituellement des distributions de dose de qualité similaires. La technique la plus appropriée pour un patient dépend de considérations comme la disponibilité d’un type particulier de traitement et son effet sur l’utilisation des ressources de planification et de traitement du service.}

	To quantify differences in treatment delivery efficiency and dosimetry between step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and helical tomotherapy (HT) for prostate treatment.
	Methods and Materials
	Twenty-five prostate cancer patients were selected retrospectively for this planning study. Treatment plans were generated for: prostate alone (n = 5), prostate + seminal vesicles (n = 5), prostate + seminal vesicles + pelvic lymph nodes (n = 5), prostate bed (n = 5), and prostate bed + pelvic lymph nodes (n = 5). Target coverage, dose homogeneity, integral dose, monitor units (MU), and sparing of organs at risk (OAR) were compared across techniques. Time required to deliver each plan was measured.
	Results
	The dosimetric quality of IMRT, VMAT, and HT plans were comparable for target coverage (planning target volume V95\%, clinical target volume V100\% all >98.7\%) and sparing of organs at risk (OAR) for all treatment groups. Although HT resulted in a slightly higher integral dose and mean doses to the OAR, it yielded a lower maximum dose to all OAR examined. VMAT resulted in reductions in treatment times over IMRT (mean = 75\%) and HT (mean = 70\%). VMAT required 15–38\% fewer monitor units than IMRT over all treatment volumes, with the reduction per fraction ranging from 100–423 MU from the smallest to largest volumes.
	Conclusions
	VMAT improves efficiency of delivery for equivalent dosimetric quality as IMRT and HT across various prostate cancer treatment volumes in the intact and postoperative settings.}

The complexity of modern radiotherapy techniques and equipment, including computer-controlled treatment machines and treatment management systems, as well as sophisticated treatment techniques that involve intensity-modulated radiation therapy, image-guided radiation therapy, stereotactic body radiation therapy, volumetric modulated arc therapy, respiratory gating, and others, leads to concern about safety issues related to that complexity. This article illustrates the relationship between complexity and computer control, and various safety problems and errors that have been reported, and describes studies that address the issue of these modern techniques and whether their complexity does, in fact, result in more errors or safety-related problems.

Recent integration of spiral computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography scans into staging has transformed localization of tumours. CT simulation has permitted the design of highly conformal treatment plans. Modern computers and linear accelerator have facilitated the delivery of these plans with intensity modulated radiotherapy. Radiotherapy and drugs are increasingly being combined to improve the therapeutic ratio. Clinical trials are means whereby new treatment approaches are evaluated.},

	abstract = {Beam direction optimization is an important problem in radiation therapy. In intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), the difficulty for computer optimization of the beam directions arises from the fact that they are coupled with the intensity profiles of the incident beams. In order to obtain the optimal incident beam directions using iterative or stochastic methods, the beam profiles ought to be optimized after every change of beam configuration. In this paper we report an effective algorithm to optimize gantry angles for IMRT. In our calculation the gantry angles and the beam profiles (beamlet weights) were treated as two separate groups of variables. The gantry angles were sampled according to a simulated annealing algorithm. For each sampled beam configuration, beam profile calculation was done using a fast filtered backprojection (FBP) method. Simulated annealing was also used for beam profile optimization to examine the performance of the FBP for beam orientation optimization. Relative importance factors were incorporated into the objective function to control the relative importance of the target and the sensitive structures. Minimization of the objective function resulted in the best possible beam orientations and beam profiles judged by the given objective function. The algorithm was applied to several model problems and the results showed that the approach has potential for IMRT applications.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the role of beam orientation optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and to examine the potential benefits of noncoplanar intensity-modulated beams. Methods and Materials: A beam orientation optimization algorithm was implemented. For this purpose, system variables were divided into two groups: beam position (gantry and table angles) and beam profile (beamlet weights). Simulated annealing was used for beam orientation optimization and the simultaneous iterative inverse treatment planning algorithm (SIITP) for beam intensity profile optimization. Three clinical cases were studied: a localized prostate cancer, a nasopharyngeal cancer, and a paraspinal tumor. Nine fields were used for all treatments. For each case, 3 types of treatment plan optimization were performed: (1) beam intensity profiles were optimized for 9 equiangular spaced coplanar beams; (2) orientations and intensity profiles were optimized for 9 coplanar beams; (3) orientations and intensity profiles were optimized for 9 noncoplanar beams. Results: For the localized prostate case, all 3 types of optimization described above resulted in dose distributions of a similar quality. For the nasopharynx case, optimized noncoplanar beams provided a significant gain in the gross tumor volume coverage. For the paraspinal case, orientation optimization using noncoplanar beams resulted in better kidney sparing and improved gross tumor volume coverage. Conclusion: The sensitivity of an IMRT treatment plan with respect to the selection of beam orientations varies from site to site. For some cases, the choice of beam orientations is important even when the number of beams is as large as 9. Noncoplanar beams provide an additional degree of freedom for IMRT treatment optimization and may allow for notable improvement in the quality of some complicated plans.}

	journal = {Physics in Medicine \& Biology},
	abstract = {Models for finding treatment plans for intensity modulated radiation therapy are usually based on a number of structure-based treatment plan evaluation criteria, which are often conflicting. Rather than formulating a model that a priori quantifies the trade-offs between these criteria, we consider a multi-criteria optimization approach that aims at finding the so-called undominated treatment plans. We present a unifying framework for studying multi-criteria optimization problems for treatment planning that establishes conditions under which treatment plan evaluation criteria can be transformed into convex criteria while preserving the set of undominated treatment plans. Such transformations are identified for many of the criteria that have been proposed to date, establishing equivalences between these criteria. In addition, it is shown that the use of a nonconvex criterion can often be avoided by transformation to an equivalent convex criterion. In particular, we show that models employing criteria such as tumour control probability, normal tissue complication probability, probability of uncomplicated tumour control, as well as sigmoidal transformations of (generalized) equivalent uniform dose are equivalent to models formulated in terms of separable voxel-based criteria that penalize dose in individual voxels.}

	abstract = {Purpose: In current intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plan optimization, the focus is on either finding optimal beam angles (or other beam delivery parameters such as field segments, couch angles, gantry angles) or optimal beam intensities. In this article we offer a mixed integer programming (MIP) approach for simultaneously determining an optimal intensity map and optimal beam angles for IMRT delivery. Using this approach, we pursue an experimental study designed to (a) gauge differences in plan quality metrics with respect to different tumor sites and different MIP treatment planning models, and (b) test the concept of critical-normal-tissue-ring—a tissue ring of 5 mm thickness drawn around the planning target volume (PTV)—and its use for designing conformal plans. Methods and Materials: Our treatment planning models use two classes of decision variables to capture the beam configuration and intensities simultaneously. Binary (0/1) variables are used to capture “on” or “off” or “yes” or “no” decisions for each field, and nonnegative continuous variables are used to represent intensities of beamlets. Binary and continuous variables are also used for each voxel to capture dose level and dose deviation from target bounds. Treatment planning models were designed to explicitly incorporate the following planning constraints: (a) upper/lower/mean dose-based constraints, (b) dose–volume and equivalent-uniform-dose (EUD) constraints for critical structures, (c) homogeneity constraints (underdose/overdose) for PTV, (d) coverage constraints for PTV, and (e) maximum number of beams allowed. Within this constrained solution space, five optimization strategies involving clinical objectives were analyzed: optimize total intensity to PTV, optimize total intensity and then optimize conformity, optimize total intensity and then optimize homogeneity, minimize total dose to critical structures, minimize total dose to critical structures and optimize conformity simultaneously. We emphasize that the objectives that include optimizing conformity make use of the critical-normal-tissue-ring. Three tumor sites: head-and-neck, pediatric brain, and prostate are used for comparison. Results: The critical-normal-tissue-ring acts as a good device for enforcing conformity. Trends in the characteristics and quality of plans resulting from each model were observed. Attempts to reduce dose to critical structures tend to worsen PTV conformity (1.542 to 3.092) and homogeneity (1.223 to 1.984), depending on the relative size and spatial distance of the critical structures to the PTV. When the critical structures are relatively small compared with the PTV (as in the case for the pediatric brain tumor, where each is less than 15 percent in volume), dose reduction to critical structures is accompanied by much worse scores in conformity (2.482) and homogeneity (1.984). When the critical structures are larger, as in the case of head-and-neck (∼50 percent), the conformity and homogeneity deterioration is less significant (1.542 and 1.239, respectively). There is a clear tradeoff between homogeneity, conformity, and minimum dose to organs at risk (OARs). For head-and-neck and pediatric brain tumor, the model that minimizes total dose to critical structures and optimizes conformity simultaneously offers a compromise among these factors, resulting in reduced critical structure dose with conformal and homogeneous plans. In the prostate case, the tumor is smaller than the two large nearby critical structures, and all models provide very homogeneous PTV dose distribution. However, minimizing dose to critical structures worsens conformity, as it spreads the radiation to the area surrounding the PTV. The maximum dose to the critical structures also increases slightly. Compared with plans used in the clinic which generally have uniformly spaced beam angles, the optimal clinically acceptable plans obtained via the methods herein do not have equispaced beams. The optimal beam angles returned appear to be nonintuitive, and depend on PTV size and geometry and the spatial relationship between the tumor and critical structures. Conclusions: The MIP model described allows simultaneous optimization over the space of beamlet fluence weights and beam and couch angles. Based on experiments with tumor data, this approach can return good plans that are clinically acceptable and practical. This work distinguishes itself from recent IMRT research in several ways. First, in previous methods beam angles are selected before intensity map optimization. Herein, we employ 0/1 variables to model the set of candidate beams, and thereby allow the optimization process itself to select optimal beams. Second, instead of incorporating dose–volume criteria within the objective function as in previous work, herein, a combination of discrete and continuous variables associated with each voxel provides a mechanism to strictly enforce dose–volume criteria within the constraints. Third, using the construct of critical-normal-tissue-ring within the objective function can enhance the achievement of conformal plans. Based on the three tumor sites considered, it appears that volume and spatial geometry with respect to the PTV are important factors to consider when selecting objectives to optimize, and in estimating how well suited a particular model is for achieving a specified goal.}

	abstract = {The static leaf sequencing (SLS) problem arises in radiation therapy for cancer treatments, aiming to accomplish the delivery of a radiation prescription to a target tumor in the minimum amount of delivery time. Geometrically, the SLS problem can be formulated as a 3-D partition problem for which the 2-D problem of partitioning a polygonal domain (possibly with holes) into a minimum set of monotone polygons is a special case. In this paper, we present new geometric algorithms for a basic case of the 3-D SLS problem (which is also of clinical value) and for the general 3-D SLS problem. Our basic 3-D SLS algorithm, based on new geometric observations, produces guaranteed optimal quality solutions using Steiner points in polynomial time; the previously best known basic 3-D SLS algorithm gives optimal outputs only for the case without any Steiner points, and its time bound involves a multiplicative factor of a factorial function of the input. Our general 3-D SLS algorithm is based on our basic 3-D SLS algorithm and a polynomial time algorithm for partitioning a polygonal domain (possibly with holes) into a minimum set of x-monotone polygons, and has a fast running time. Experiments and comparisons using real medical data and on a real radiotherapy machine have shown that our 3-D SLS algorithms and software produce treatment plans that use significantly shorter delivery time and give better treatment quality than the current most popular commercial treatment planning system and the most well-known SLS algorithm. Some of our techniques and geometric procedures (e.g., for the problem of partitioning a polygonal domain into a minimum set of x-monotone polygons) are interesting in their own right.},

The treatment time and machine delivery error are two crucial factors of a solution (i.e., a treatment plan) for the SLS problem. In this paper, we prove that the 3-D SLS problem is NP-hard, and present the first ever algorithm for the 3-D SLS problem that can determine a tradeoff between the treatment time and machine delivery error (also called the ``tongue-and-groove'' error in medical literature). Our new 3-D SLS algorithm with error control gives the users (e.g., physicians) the option of specifying a machine delivery error bound, and subject to the given error bound, the algorithm computes a treatment plan with the minimum treatment time. We formulate the SLS problem with error control as computing a k-weight shortest path in a directed graph and build the graph by computing g-matchings and minimum cost flows. Further, we extend our 3-D SLS algorithm to the popular radiotherapy machine models with different constraints. In our extensions, we model the SLS problems for some of the radiotherapy systems as computing a minimum g-path cover of a directed acyclic graph. We implemented our new 3-D SLS algorithm suite and conducted an extensive comparison study with commercial planning systems and well-known algorithms in medical literature.

	abstract = {With MLC-based IMRT, the maximum usable field size is often smaller than the maximum field size for conventional treatments. This is due to the constraints of the overtravel distances of MLC leaves and/or jaws. Using a new leaf sequencing algorithm, the usable IMRT field length (perpendicular to the MLC motion) can be mostly made equal to the full length of the MLC field without violating the upper jaw overtravel limit. For any given intensity pattern, a criterion was proposed to assess whether an intensity pattern can be delivered without violation of the jaw position constraints. If the criterion is met, the new algorithm will consider the jaw position constraints during the segmentation for the step and shoot delivery method. The strategy employed by the algorithm is to connect the intensity elements outside the jaw overtravel limits with those inside the jaw overtravel limits. Several methods were used to establish these connections during segmentation by modifying a previously published algorithm (areal algorithm), including changing the intensity level, alternating the leaf-sequencing direction, or limiting the segment field size. The algorithm was tested with 1000 random intensity patterns with dimensions of 21×27 cm2, 800 intensity patterns with higher intensity outside the jaw overtravel limit, and three different types of clinical treatment plans that were undeliverable using a segmentation method from a commercial treatment planning system. The new algorithm achieved a success rate of 100\% with these test patterns. For the 1000 random patterns, the new algorithm yields a similar average number of segments of 36.9±2.9 in comparison to 36.6±1.3 when using the areal algorithm. For the 800 patterns with higher intensities outside the jaw overtravel limits, the new algorithm results in an increase of 25\% in the average number of segments compared to the areal algorithm. However, the areal algorithm fails to create deliverable segments for 90\% of these patterns. Using a single isocenter, the new algorithm provides a solution to extend the usable IMRT field length from 21 to 27 cm for IMRT on a commercial linear accelerator using the step and shoot delivery method.},

	abstract = {IMRT treatment plans for step-and-shoot delivery have traditionally been produced through the optimization of intensity distributions (or maps) for each beam angle. The optimization step is followed by the application of a leaf-sequencing algorithm that translates each intensity map into a set of deliverable aperture shapes. In this article, we introduce an automated planning system in which we bypass the traditional intensity optimization, and instead directly optimize the shapes and the weights of the apertures. We call this approach “direct aperture optimization.” This technique allows the user to specify the maximum number of apertures per beam direction, and hence provides significant control over the complexity of the treatment delivery. This is possible because the machine dependent delivery constraints imposed by the MLC are enforced within the aperture optimization algorithm rather than in a separate leaf-sequencing step. The leaf settings and the aperture intensities are optimized simultaneously using a simulated annealing algorithm. We have tested direct aperture optimization on a variety of patient cases using the EGS4/BEAM Monte Carlo package for our dose calculation engine. The results demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can produce highly conformal step-and-shoot treatment plans using only three to five apertures per beam direction. As compared with traditional optimization strategies, our studies demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can result in a significant reduction in both the number of beam segments and the number of monitor units. Direct aperture optimization therefore produces highly efficient treatment deliveries that maintain the full dosimetric benefits of IMRT.},

	journal = {Physics in Medicine \& Biology},
	abstract = {Intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT) is a radiation therapy delivery technique that combines gantry rotation with dynamic multi-leaf collimation (MLC). With IMAT, the benefits of rotational IMRT can be realized using a conventional linear accelerator and a conventional MLC. Thus far, the advantages of IMAT have gone largely unrealized due to the lack of robust automated planning tools capable of producing efficient IMAT treatment plans. This work describes an inverse treatment planning algorithm, called ‘direct aperture optimization’ (DAO) that can be used to generate inverse treatment plans for IMAT. In contrast to traditional inverse planning techniques where the relative weights of a series of pencil beams are optimized, DAO optimizes the leaf positions and weights of the apertures in the plan. This technique allows any delivery constraints to be enforced during the optimization, eliminating the need for a leaf-sequencing step. It is this feature that enables DAO to easily create inverse plans for IMAT. To illustrate the feasibility of DAO applied to IMAT, several cases are presented, including a cylindrical phantom, a head and neck patient and a prostate patient.}

Methods and Materials: We retrospectively designed DAO-IMRT plans for 15 breast cancer patients in supine (10 patients) and prone (5 patients) positions with a goal of uniform dose coverage of the whole breast. These DAO-IMRT plans were compared with standard IMRT using beamlet optimization and conventional 3D-CRT plans using wedges. All plans used opposed tangential beam arrangements. Results: In all cases, the DAO-IMRT plans were equal to or better than those generated with 3D-CRT and standard beamlet-IMRT. For supine cases, DAO-IMRT provided higher uniformity index (UI, defined as the ratio of the dose to 95\% of breast volume to the maximum dose) than either 3D-CRT (0.88 vs. 0.82; p = 0.026) or beamlet-IMRT (0.89 vs. 0.85; p = 0.003). Direct aperture optimized IMRT also gave lower lung doses than either 3D-CRT (V20 = 7.9\% vs. 8.6\%; p = 0.024) or beamlet-IMRT (V20 = 8.4\% vs. 9.7\%; p = 0.0008) for supine patients.

The planning time for DAO-IMRT was approximately 75\% less than that of 3D-CRT. The monitor units for DAO-IMRT were approximately 60\% less than those of beamlet-IMRT. Conclusion: Direct aperture optimized IMRT improved the overall quality of dose distributions as well as the planning and delivery efficiency for treating whole breast in both supine and prone positions.}

	abstract = "{Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a widely accepted method for radiation treatment to provide a prescribed and uniform dose to the target volume and a minimum dose to normal tissues that is dependent on the IMRT software and the treatment machine. We examined the variation in IMRT dose prescription, treatment planning, dose recording, and dose delivery among cancer patients who were treated with different treatment planning systems at different medical institutions to assess variability in patient care.We conducted a retrospective analysis of 803 patients who were treated with IMRT between October 2004 and July 2006 for brain, head and neck, or prostate cancer at five medical institutions that used different treatment planning systems. The prescribed dose to the target volume, as recorded in the chart or as noted in the electronic data management system, was extracted for each patient. The planned dose that was delivered to the patient, as represented in the dose–volume histogram, was acquired from each treatment planning system. The actual minimum, maximum, median, and isocenter doses to the target volume were normalized to the prescribed dose and analyzed for each disease site and institution.Of the 803 patients, 12\% were treated for brain cancer, 26\% for head and neck cancer, and 62\% for prostate cancer. The recorded dose variability from prescription was widespread for the minimum, maximum, and isocenter doses. A total of 46\% of the patients received a maximum dose that was more than 10\% higher than the prescribed dose, and 63\% of the patients received a dose that was more than 10\% lower than the prescribed dose. At all five institutions, the prostate cancer cases had the smallest dosimetric variation and the head and neck cancer cases had the largest variation. The median dose to the target varied from the prescribed dose by ±2\% in 68\% of the patients, by ±5\% in 88\% of the patients, and by ±10\% in 96\% of the patients. The recorded isocenter dose varied from prescription for all disease sites and treatment planning systems.Substantial variation in the prescribed and delivered doses exists among medical institutions, raising concerns about the validity of comparing clinical outcomes for IMRT. The isocenter dose in IMRT is simply a point dose and often does not reflect the prescription dose that is specified by a selected isodose line encompassing the target volume. This study suggests the need for national and/or international guidelines for dose prescription, planning, and reporting for a meaningful clinical trial in IMRT.}",

	abstract = {Summary A multicentre planning study comparing intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans for the treatment of a head and neck cancer has been carried out. Three Australian radiotherapy centres, each with a different planning system, were supplied a fully contoured CT dataset and requested to generate an IMRT plan in accordance with the requirements of an IMRT-based radiation therapy oncology group clinical trial. Plan analysis was carried out using software developed specifically for reviewing multicentre clinical trial data. Two out of the three plans failed to meet the prescription requirements with one misinterpreting the prescription and the third failed to meet one of the constraints. Only one plan achieved all of the dose objectives for the critical structures and normal tissues. Although each centre used very similar planning parameters and beam arrangements the resulting plans were quite different. The subjective interpretation and application of the prescription and planning objectives emphasize one of the many difficulties in carrying out multicentre IMRT planning studies. The treatment prescription protocol in a clinical trial must be both lucid and unequivocally stated to avoid misinterpretation. Australian radiotherapy centres must show that they can produce a quality IMRT plan and that they can adhere to protocols for IMRT planning before using it in a clinical trial.},
