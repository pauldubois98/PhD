	abstract = { The health effects of low-dose radiation (LDR) have been the concern of the academic spheres, regulatory bodies, governments, and the public. Among these effects, the most important is carcinogenesis. In view of the importance of immune surveillance in cancer control, the dose-response relationship of the changes in different cell types of the immune system after whole-body irradiation is analyzed on the basis of systemic data from the author's laboratory in combination with recent reports in the literature. For T lymphocytes J- or inverted J-shaped curves are usually demonstrated after irradiation, while for macrophages dose-response curves of chiefly stimulation with irregular patterns are often observed. The intercellular reactions between the antigen presenting cell (APC) and T lymphocyte (TLC) in the immunologic synapse via expression of surface molecules and secretion of cytokines by the two cell types after different doses of radiation are illustrated. The different pathways of signal transduction thus facilitated in the T lymphocyte by different doses of radiation are analyzed to explain the mechanism of the phenomenon of low-dose stimulation and high-dose suppression of immunity. Experimental and clinical data are cited to show that LDR retards tumor growth, reduces metastasis, increases the efficacy of conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy as well as alleviates the suppression of immunity due to tumor burden. The incidence of thymic lymphoma after high-dose radiation is lowered by preexposure to low-dose radiation, and its mechanism is supposed to be related to the stimulation of anticancer immunity induced by low-dose radiation. Recent reports on lowering of standardized cancer mortality rate and all cause death rate of cohorts occupationally exposed to low-dose radiation from the US, UK, and Canada are cited. }

	abstract  = "Rapid developments in imaging techniques, including functional imaging, have fueled the drive to implement new methods of delivering three-dimensional radiation therapy, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), with unprecedented accuracy. In comparison with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) it is now possible with IMRT to escalate the absorbed dose in the target volume for the same normal tissue dose and/or to reduce the normal tissue dose for the same tumor dose, resulting in improved tumor control and/or less normal tissue complications. IMRT is accomplished by the sequential isocentric delivery of multiple small beams typically of non-uniform intensity that can lead to the generation of very steep dose gradients. To meet the requirements of such sophisticated beam delivery techniques both tumor and normal tissue volumes must be delineated in 3D with high precision. The use of dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the specification of absorbed dose is inherent to the treatment modality. The demands on treatment planning systems to ensure accurate dose delivery necessitate the employment of complex iterative optimization processes. The stringent requirements on precision for the entire treatment process from imaging to treatment entail the implementation of comprehensive commissioning and quality assurance programs. The present report provides the information necessary to standardize techniques and procedures and to harmonize the prescribing, recording, and reporting of IMRT where possible with those of other modalities. Applicable concepts and recommendations in other ICRU reports concerning radiation therapy are adopted and extended where required. Clinical examples of IMRT are provided to illustrate the recommendations of prescribing, recording, and reporting that are contained in this report. As the present report describes in some detail the physical, technical, treatment planning and clinical aspects of IMRT, it should be a useful reference for current practitioners and should also provide new and potential users, as well as other interested readers, with the basic background to enable them to understand the techniques involved and the requirements for implementing IMRT."

	abstract = {Hypotheses regarding tissue organization and radiation response were described and, on the basis of simple modeling, tentative conclusions were drawn regarding the influence on “tolerance” doses of tissue organization and the volume of an organ irradiated. (1) A functional subunit (FSU) may be defined structurally (e.g. as in a nephron), or only functionally, as the largest unit of cells capable of being regenerated from a surviving clonogenic cell without loss of the specified function. (2) Functional subunits may be arranged in parallel or in series: in parallel they give rise to graded dose responses, whereas in series, they give rise to threshold binary, or quantum responses. (3) Tolerance doses are a function of the number and radiosensitivity of target cells in an FSU, tissue organization and the functional reserve (i.e. the proportion of functional subunits necessary for adequate organ function). (4) An influence of treatment volume on “tolerance” doses is more likely to depend upon tissue organization than upon differences in cellular radiosensitivity. (5) The volume of tissue irradiated would be expected to be irrelevant to the “tolerance” of tissues showing a graded dose response (e.g. skin desquamation), except when the injury becomes severe, when tolerance for a large severe wound is likely to be less than for a small volume of injury, for non-radiobiological reasons. (6) Tissues with FSU's arranged in series, for example, spinal cord or peritoneal sheath along small bowel, should show a threshold-binary response. Sigmoid dose response curves should have a lower threshold and be steeper the larger the treatment volume. The effect of increase in volume is greatest with changes in small volumes: once a large number of FSU's are being irradiated, a further increase in volume has little effect on the position or slope of the probability curve for such complications. (7) Because their sigmoid dose-response curves are steep, threshold-binary tissues are sensitive to small increases in “biologically effective” dose. For example, when the spinal cord is treated with large dose fractions the biological effectiveness per unit of dose increases sharply. Thus, using a large volume together with large dose fractions, as could happen in palliative prescriptions, could augment the danger of myelitis. (8) Because of the low density of cells potentially the “targets” for peritoneal adhesion formation and small bowel obstruction, and because a measurable incidence of obstruction is usually already “tolerated,” the most marked effect of changes of treatment volume on complications in clinical practice may be found with postoperative abdominal and pelvic irradiation.}

	abstract = {Abstract Purpose To evaluate the clinical feasibility of the Siemens Healthineers AI-Rad Companion Organs RT VA30A (Organs-RT) auto-contouring algorithm for organs at risk (OARs) of the pelvis, thorax, and head and neck (H\&N). Methods Computed tomography (CT) datasets from 30 patients (10 pelvis, 10 thorax, and 10 H\&N) were collected. Four sets of OARs were generated on each scan, one set by Organs-RT and the others by three experienced users independently. A physician (expert) then evaluated each contour by assigning a score from the following scale: 1-Must Redo, 2-Major Edits, 3-Minor Edits, 4-Clinically usable. Using the highest-scored OAR from the human users as a reference, the contours generated by Organs-RT were evaluated via Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDD), Mean Distance to Agreement (mDTA), Volume comparison, and visual inspection. Additionally, each human user recorded the time to delineate each structure set and time-saving efficiency was measured. Results The average DSC obtained for the pelvic OARs ranged between (0.81 ± 0.06)Rectum and (0.94 ± 0.03)Bladder.

The average HDD in cm for the pelvis cohort ranged between (0.95 ± 0.35)Bladder to (3.62 ± 2.50)Rectum, (0.42 ± 0.06)SpinalCord to (2.09 ± 2.00)Esophagus for the thoracic set and (0.53±0.22)Cerv\_SpinalCord\${( {0.53 \pm 0.22} )}\_{{\mathrm{Cerv}}\\_{\mathrm{SpinalCord}}}\$ to (1.50 ± 0.50)Mandible for the H\&N region. The time-saving efficiency was 67\% for H\&N, 83\% for pelvis, and 84\% for thorax. 72.5\%, 82\%, and 50\% of the pelvis, thorax, and H\&N OARs were scored as clinically usable by the expert, respectively. Conclusions The highest agreement registered between OARs generated by Organs-RT and their respective references was for the bladder, heart, lungs, and femoral heads, with an overall DSC≥0.92. The poorest agreement was for the rectum, esophagus, and lips, with an overall DSC⩽0.81. Nonetheless, Organs-RT serves as a reliable auto-contouring tool by minimizing overall contouring time and increasing time-saving efficiency in radiotherapy treatment planning.},

AI-based auto-contouring is proposed as a solution to these problems if it can produce clinically acceptable results. This study investigated the performance of multiple AI-based auto-contouring systems in different OAR segmentations. The auto-contouring was performed using seven different AI-based segmentation systems (Radiotherapy AI, Limbus AI version 1.5 and 1.6, Therapanacea, MIM, Siemens AI-Rad Companion and RadFormation) on a total of 42 clinical cases with varying anatomical sites. Volumetric and surface dice similarity coefficients and maximum Hausdorff distance (HD) between the expert's contours and automated contours were calculated to evaluate their performance. Radiotherapy AI has shown better performance than other software in most tested structures considered in the head and neck, and brain cases. No specific software had shown overall superior performance over other software in lung, breast, pelvis and abdomen cases. Each tested AI system was able to produce comparable contours to the experts' contours of organs at risk which can potentially be used for clinical use. A reduced performance of AI systems in the case of small and complex anatomical structures was found and reported, showing that it is still essential to review each contour produced by AI systems for clinical uses. This study has also demonstrated a method of comparing contouring software options which could be replicated in clinics or used for ongoing quality assurance of purchased systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background Radiation treatment is considered an effective and the most common treatment option for prostate cancer. The treatment planning process requires accurate and precise segmentation of the prostate and organs at risk (OARs), which is laborious and time-consuming when contoured manually. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based auto-segmentation has the potential to significantly accelerate the radiation therapy treatment planning process; however, the accuracy of auto-segmentation needs to be validated before its full clinical adoption. Purpose A commercial AI-based contouring model was trained to provide segmentation of the prostate and surrounding OARs. The segmented structures were input to a commercial auto-planning module for automated prostate treatment planning. This study comprehensively evaluates the performance of this contouring model in the automated prostate treatment planning process. Methods and materials A 3D U-Net-based model (INTContour, Carina AI) was trained and validated on 84 computed tomography (CT) scans and tested on an additional 23 CT scans from patients treated in our local institution. Prostate and OARs contours generated by the AI model (AI contour) were geometrically evaluated against reference contours. The prostate contours were further evaluated against AI, reference, and two additional observer contours for comparison using inter-observer variation (IOV) and 3D boundaries discrepancy analyses. A blinded evaluation was introduced to assess subjectively the clinical acceptability of the AI contours. Finally, treatment plans were created from an automated prostate planning workflow using the AI contours and were evaluated for their clinical acceptability following the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-0815 protocol. Results The AI contours demonstrated good geometric accuracy on OARs and prostate contours, with average Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) for bladder, rectum, femoral heads, seminal vesicles, and penile bulb of 0.93, 0.85, 0.96, 0.72, and 0.53, respectively. The DSC, 95\% directed Hausdorff distance (HD95), and mean surface distance for the prostate were 0.83 ± 0.05, 6.07 ± 1.87 mm, and 2.07 ± 0.73 mm, respectively. No significant differences were found when comparing with IOV. In the double-blinded evaluation, 95.7\% of the AI contours were scored as either “perfect” (34.8\%) or “acceptable” (60.9\%), while only one case (4.3\%) was scored as “unacceptable with minor changes required.” In total, 69.6\% of the AI contours were considered equal to or better than the reference contours by an independent radiation oncologist. Automated treatment plans created from the AI contours produced similar and clinically acceptable dosimetric distributions as those from plans created from reference contours. Conclusions The investigated AI-based commercial model for prostate segmentation demonstrated good performance in clinical practice. Using this model, the implementation of an automated prostate treatment planning process is clinically feasible.},

	abstract = { Gonadal development in Arctic cod starts in August in high Arctic Canada. Male gonads develop at a faster rate than female gonads initially, and reach maximum size about two months prior to females. Under laboratory conditions (at 1.0 °C), female Arctic cod became ripe and started to spawn in mid-February, which concurred with field observations. Ripe gonad weight increased with body size; mean gonadosomatic index (GSI) of ripe females was 47.7\%, and potential fecundity averaged 26 500 eggs. At the time when ripe females started to spawn, some females were still unripe (GSI = 20.2\%). Their eggs were not hydrated, and these fish had significantly higher levels of sex steroids (estradiol, 11-ketotestosterone, and testosterone) in their blood than ripe fish. Arctic cod are repeat spawners, at least under laboratory conditions, in spite of the large amount of energy allocated to reproduction (306 kJ lost from liver and muscle during gonadal development and 125 kJ as eggs during spawning). A high energy investment into reproduction, for a fish that matures at an early age, may be balanced against high predation rates on this species during the open-water season in the Canadian high Arctic. }
