	abstract = {Purpose To develop a deep learning method to predict patient-specific dose volume histograms (DVHs) for radiotherapy planning. Methods Patient data included 180 cases with nasopharyngeal cancer, of which 153 cases were used for training and 27 for testing. A network (named “DVHnet”) based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed for directly predicting DVHs of organs at risk (OARs). Two-channel images with contoured structures were generated as the inputs for training the model. A one-dimensional array consisting of 256 continuous volume percentages on a DVH curve for each slice was calculated as the corresponding output. The combined DVH was then calculated. Sixteen OARs were modeled in the study. Prediction accuracy was evaluated against the corresponding DVH curve of ground truth (GT) plans. A global DVH analysis and critical dosimetry metrics for each OAR were calculated for quantitative evaluation. The performance of DVHnet also was evaluated against two baselines: DosemapNet (developed by our research group) and commercial RapidPlan software. Results The predicted mean difference in average dose of all OARs using DVHnet was 0.30 ± 0.95 Gy. And the predicted differences in D2\% and D50 can be control within 2.32 and 0.69 Gy. For most OARs, there were no obvious differences between the dosimetric metrics of the predicted and GT values for both DVHnet and DosemapNet (P ≥ 0.05). Only the predicted D2\% of the optic organs for DVHnet, and of brain stem PRV for DosemapNet displayed statistically significant differences. Except for the optic organs, DVHnet performs better than or comparably with RapidPlan. The mean difference in proportion of points of interest was 3.59\% ± 7.78\%. Conclusions A deep learning network model was developed to automatically extract useful features for accurate prediction of patient-specific DVH curves directly. The performance of DVHnet was comparable to DosemapNet and RapidPlan.},

	abstract = {Purpose Despite improvements in optimization and automation algorithms, the quality of radiation treatment plans still varies dramatically. A tool that allows a priori estimation of the best possible sparing (Feasibility DVH, or FDVH) of an organ at risk (OAR) in high-energy photon planning may help reduce plan quality variability by deriving patient-specific OAR goals prior to optimization. Such a tool may be useful for (a) meaningfully evaluating patient-specific plan quality and (b) supplying best theoretically achievable DVH goals, thus pushing the solution toward automatic Pareto optimality. This work introduces such a tool and validates it for clinical Head and Neck (HN) datasets. Methods To compute FDVH, first the targets are assigned uniform prescription doses, with no reference to any particular beam arrangement. A benchmark 3D dose built outside the targets is estimated using a series of energy-specific dose spread calculations reflecting observed properties of radiation distribution in media. For the patient, the calculation is performed on the heterogeneous dataset, taking into account the high- (penumbra driven) and low- (PDD and scatter-driven) gradient dose spreading. The former is driven mostly by target dose and surface shape, while the latter adds the dependence on target volume. This benchmark dose is used to produce the “best possible sparing” FDVH for an OAR, and based on it, progressively more easily achievable FDVH curves can be estimated. Validation was performed using test cylindrical geometries as well as 10 clinical HN datasets. For HN, VMAT plans were prepared with objectives of covering the primary and the secondary (bilateral elective neck) PTVs while addressing only one OAR at a time, with the goal of maximum sparing. The OARs were each parotid, the larynx, and the inferior pharyngeal constrictor. The difference in mean OAR doses was computed for the achieved vs. FDVHs, and the shapes of those DVHs were compared by means of the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Results For all individually optimized HN OARs (N = 38), the average DSC between the planned DVHs and the FDVHs was 0.961 ± 0.018 (95\% CI 0.955–0.967), with the corresponding average of mean OAR dose differences of 1.8 ± 5.8\% (CI −0.1–3.6\%). For realistic plans the achieved DVHs run no lower than the FDVHs, except when target coverage is compromised at the target/OAR interface. Conclusions For the validation of VMAT plans, the OAR DVHs optimized one-at-a-time were similar in shape to and bound on the low side by the FDVHs, within the confines of planner's ability to precisely cover the target(s) with the prescription dose(s). The method is best suited for the OARs close to the target. This approach is fundamentally different from “knowledge-based planning” because it is (a) independent of the treatment plan and prior experience, and (b) it approximates, from nearly first principles, the lowest possible boundary of the OAR DVH, but not necessarily its actual shape in the presence of competing OAR sparing and target dose homogeneity objectives.},

	abstract  = {PURPOSE: To propose a clinically feasible automatic planning
	solution for external beam intensity-modulated radiotherapy,
	including dose prediction via a deep learning and voxel-based
	optimization strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dose
	distribution of patients was predicted using a U-Net-based deep
	learning network based on the patient's anatomy information. One
	hundred seventeen patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and
	200 patients with rectal cancer were enrolled in this study. For
	NPC cases, 94 cases were included in the training dataset, 13 in
	the validation dataset, and 10 in the testing dataset. For
	rectal cancer cases, 172 cases were included in the training
	set, 18 in the validation set, and 10 in the testing set. A
	voxel-based optimization strategy, ``Voxel,'' was proposed to
	achieve treatment planning optimization by dividing body voxels
	into two parts: inside planning target volumes (PTVs) and
	outside PTVs. Fixed dose-volume objectives were attached to the
	total objective function to realize individualized planning
	intended as the ``hybrid'' optimizing strategy. Automatically
	generated plans were compared with clinically approved plans to
	evaluate clinical gains, according to dosimetric indices and
	dose-volume histograms (DVHs). RESULTS: Similarities were found
	between the DVH of the predicted dose and clinical plan,
	although significant differences were found in some organs at
	risk. Better organ sparing and suboptimal PTV coverage were
	shown using the voxel strategy; however, the deviations in
	homogeneity indices (HIs) and conformity indices (CIs) of the
	PTV between automatically generated plans and manual plans were
	reduced by the hybrid strategy ([manual plans]/[voxel
	plans[/[hybrid plans]: HI of PTV70 [1.06/1.12/1.02] and CI of
	PTV70 [0.79/0.58/0.76]). The optimization time for each patient
	was within 1 min and included fluence map optimization, leaf
	sequencing, and control point optimization. All the generated
	plans (voxel and hybrid strategy) could be delivered on
	uRT-linac 506c (United Imaging Healthcare, Shanghai, China).
	CONCLUSION: Deliverable plans can be generated by incorporating
	a voxel-based optimization strategy into a commercial treatment
	planning system (TPS). The hybrid optimization method shows the
	benefit and clinical feasibility in generating clinically
	acceptable plans.},

	abstract = {Abstract Purpose Deep learning–based knowledge-based planning (KBP) methods have been introduced for radiotherapy dose distribution prediction to reduce the planning time and maintain consistent high-quality plans. This paper presents a novel KBP model using an attention-gating mechanism and a three-dimensional (3D) U-Net for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 3D dose distribution prediction in head-and-neck cancer. Methods A total of 340 head-and-neck cancer plans, representing the OpenKBP—2020 AAPM Grand Challenge data set, were used in this study. All patients were treated with the IMRT technique and a dose prescription of 70 Gy. The data set was randomly divided into 64\%/16\%/20\% as training/validation/testing cohorts. An attention-gated 3D U-Net architecture model was developed to predict full 3D dose distribution. The developed model was trained using the mean-squared error loss function, Adam optimization algorithm, a learning rate of 0.001, 120 epochs, and batch size of 4. In addition, a baseline U-Net model was also similarly trained for comparison. The model performance was evaluated on the testing data set by comparing the generated dose distributions against the ground-truth dose distributions using dose statistics and clinical dosimetric indices. Its performance was also compared to the baseline model and the reported results of other deep learning-based dose prediction models. Results The proposed attention-gated 3D U-Net model showed high capability in accurately predicting 3D dose distributions that closely replicated the ground-truth dose distributions of 68 plans in the test set. The average value of the mean absolute dose error was 2.972 ± 1.220 Gy (vs. 2.920 ± 1.476 Gy for a baseline U-Net) in the brainstem, 4.243 ± 1.791 Gy (vs. 4.530 ± 2.295 Gy for a baseline U-Net) in the left parotid, 4.622 ± 1.975 Gy (vs. 4.223 ± 1.816 Gy for a baseline U-Net) in the right parotid, 3.346 ± 1.198 Gy (vs. 2.958 ± 0.888 Gy for a baseline U-Net) in the spinal cord, 6.582 ± 3.748 Gy (vs. 5.114 ± 2.098 Gy for a baseline U-Net) in the esophagus, 4.756 ± 1.560 Gy (vs. 4.992 ± 2.030 Gy for a baseline U-Net) in the mandible, 4.501 ± 1.784 Gy (vs. 4.925 ± 2.347 Gy for a baseline U-Net) in the larynx, 2.494 ± 0.953 Gy (vs. 2.648 ± 1.247 Gy for a baseline U-Net) in the PTV\_70, and 2.432 ± 2.272 Gy (vs. 2.811 ± 2.896 Gy for a baseline U-Net) in the body contour. The average difference in predicting the D99 value for the targets (PTV\_70, PTV\_63, and PTV\_56) was 2.50 ± 1.77 Gy. For the organs at risk, the average difference in predicting the Dmax\${D\_{max}}\$ (brainstem, spinal cord, and mandible) and Dmean\${D\_{mean}}\$ (left parotid, right parotid, esophagus, and larynx) values was 1.43 ± 1.01 and 2.44 ± 1.73 Gy, respectively. The average value of the homogeneity index was 7.99 ± 1.45 for the predicted plans versus 5.74 ± 2.95 for the ground-truth plans, whereas the average value of the conformity index was 0.63 ± 0.17 for the predicted plans versus 0.89 ± 0.19 for the ground-truth plans. The proposed model needs less than 5 s to predict a full 3D dose distribution of 64 × 64 × 64 voxels for a new patient that is sufficient for real-time applications. Conclusions The attention-gated 3D U-Net model demonstrated a capability in predicting accurate 3D dose distributions for head-and-neck IMRT plans with consistent quality. The prediction performance of the proposed model was overall superior to a baseline standard U-Net model, and it was also competitive to the performance of the best state-of-the-art dose prediction method reported in the literature. The proposed model could be used to obtain dose distributions for decision-making before planning, quality assurance of planning, and guiding-automated planning for improved plan consistency, quality, and planning efficiency.},

	abstract = {Abstract Purpose External radiation therapy planning is a highly complex and tedious process as it involves treating large target volumes, prescribing several levels of doses, as well as avoiding irradiating critical structures such as organs at risk close to the tumor target. This requires highly trained dosimetrists and physicists to generate a personalized plan and adapt it as treatment evolves, thus affecting the overall tumor control and patient outcomes. Our aim is to achieve accurate dose predictions for head and neck (H\&N) cancer patients on a challenging in-house dataset that reflects realistic variability and to further compare and validate the method on a public dataset. Methods We propose a three-dimensional (3D) deep neural network that combines a hierarchically dense architecture with an attention U-net (HDA U-net). We investigate a domain knowledge objective, incorporating a weighted mean squared error (MSE) with a dose-volume histogram (DVH) loss function. The proposed HDA U-net using the MSE-DVH loss function is compared with two state-of-the-art U-net variants on two radiotherapy datasets of H\&N cases. These include reference dose plans, computed tomography (CT) information, organs at risk (OARs), and planning target volume (PTV) delineations. All models were evaluated using coverage, homogeneity, and conformity metrics as well as mean dose error and DVH curves. Results Overall, the proposed architecture outperformed the comparative state-of-the-art methods, reaching 0.95 (0.98) on D95 coverage, 1.06 (1.07) on the maximum dose value, 0.10 (0.08) on homogeneity, 0.53 (0.79) on conformity index, and attaining the lowest mean dose error on PTVs of 1.7\% (1.4\%) for the in-house (public) dataset. The improvements are statistically significant (p<0.05\$p\&lt;0.05\$) for the homogeneity and maximum dose value compared with the closest baseline. All models offer a near real-time prediction, measured between 0.43 and 0.88 s per volume. Conclusion The proposed method achieved similar performance on both realistic in-house data and public data compared to the attention U-net with a DVH loss, and outperformed other methods such as HD U-net and HDA U-net with standard MSE losses. The use of the DVH objective for training showed consistent improvements to the baselines on most metrics, supporting its added benefit in H\&N cancer cases. The quick prediction time of the proposed method allows for real-time applications, providing physicians a method to generate an objective end goal for the dosimetrist to use as reference for planning. This could considerably reduce the number of iterations between the two expert physicians thus reducing the overall treatment planning time.},

	radiotherapy planning, its application to the specific scenario
	of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases using
	fixed-field intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) on a

	and verify a deep learning-guided automated planning protocol
	tailored for this scenario. Methods: We collected 70 SRS plans
	for solitary brain metastases, of which 36 cases were for
	training and 34 for testing. Test cases were derived from two
	distinct clinical institutions. The envisioned automated planning
	process comprised (1): clinical dose prediction facilitated by
	deep-learning algorithms (2); transformation of the forecasted
	dose into executable plans via voxel-centric dose emulation (3);
	validation of the envisaged plan employing a precise dosimeter in
	conjunction with a linear accelerator. Dose prediction paradigms
	were established by engineering and refining two
	three-dimensional UNet architectures (UNet and AttUNet). Input
	parameters encompassed computed tomography scans from clinical
	plans and demarcations of the focal point alongside organs at
	potential risk (OARs); the ensuing output manifested as a 3D dose
	matrix tailored for each case under scrutiny. Results: Dose
	estimations rendered by both models mirrored the manual plans and
	adhered to clinical stipulations. As projected by the dual
	models, the apex and average doses for OARs did not deviate
	appreciably from those delineated in the manual plan
	(P-value$\geq$0.05). AttUNet showed promising results compared to

	dose gradient, with peak concentrations localized within the
