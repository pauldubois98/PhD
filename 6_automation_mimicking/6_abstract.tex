The previous chapter discussed automation techniques that enhance classical treatment plan optimization methods.
This chapter focuses on novel automation techniques for radiotherapy treatment planning that bypass traditional optimization frameworks.
With the advent of deep learning, dose prediction models have emerged, offering an alternative approach to generating treatment plans.
These models predict synthetic 3D dose distributions, which can be used in dose mimicking to create clinically deliverable treatment plans.
In this chapter, we explore advancements in dose prediction techniques, explicitly focusing on methods that improve the accuracy and adaptability of these predictions.
By incorporating additional information, such as Dose-Volume Histograms, we propose methods to make dose prediction models more clinically relevant and capable of generating treatment plans that align with varying prescription protocols and dosimetrist preferences.
