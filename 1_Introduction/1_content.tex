\section{Introduction to Cancer}

% mention there is lots of research
% mention there's hope to have better treatment
* what is cancer?\\
  * Cells proliferating
  * DNA messed up 
  * variety of cancer\\
  * some ok (e.g.: mole/freckle)\\
  * some not ok, worse make the human die
	
* who is concerned? \\
  * more and more ppl, demographic figures\\
  * environment impacts the probability of getting cancer (e.g.: UV exposure)\\
  * living habits (e.g.: smooking)\\
  * genetic impacts as well (e.g. "cancer gene")
	
* possible treatments \\
  * there main, quick comparison\\
  * say which treatment is mostly used\\

* 10 cancer markers / cancer is "smart"\\
  * cell proliferation\\
  * reprogram cellular metabolism\\
  * stop cell growth arrest\\
  * evade apoptosis\\
  * escape immune system\\
  * ability to undergo a sufficient number of successive cell cycles of growth and division to generate macroscopic tumors\\
  * create new blog vessels to get nutriments\\
  * allow cell escape and metastasis formation\\
  * change cellular response phenotypic via plasticity\\
  * senescence\\
  
  * cancer can be considered as a living thing on its own\\
  * beyond the cellular level, impacting tissues\\

* 4 cancer conditions\\
  * mutation\\
  * epigenetic reprogramming\\
  * inflammatory context\\
  * disruption of microbiota\\

* phases of cancer\\
  * initiation\\
  * promotion\\
  * tumorigenesis + neoangiogenesis\\
  * evolution (local, regional, metastasis)\\

* cancer classification:\\
  * tumor, node, mestastasis\\
  * stages classification:\\
    * stage 0 which corresponds to a so-called in situ tumor\\
    * stage 1 which corresponds to a single, small tumor\\
    * stage 2 which corresponds to a larger local volume\\
    * stage 3 which corresponds to invasion of the lymph nodes or surrounding tissues\\
    * stage 4 which corresponds to a wider extension in the body in the form of metastases\\

* cancer causes\\
  *(various reasons why: environment, inherited mutations, mistake in DNA copy)\\
 

* personalized treatments\\
  * revolution\\
  * rapid advances\\
  * help of mathematics\\
  * help of AI\\

\section{Introduction to Mathematical Optimization}

* optimization def: selection of a best element, with regard to some criteria

* in math: more precisely: optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input

* notion of allowed set

* discrete vs continuous optim

* many real-world and theoretical problems may be modeled in continuous general framework. 

* max(f) <=> min(-f) hence only min

* notion of local vs global min

* feasibility\\
* existance

* optim algos\\
  * 1st order\\
    * gradient descent\\
    * line search\\
    * quasi-newton methods\\
  * 2nd order\\
    * newton's method\\
  * 0th order\\
    * brute force\\
    * heuristics\\

* least squares

* multi-objective optimization

\section{Introduction to Artificial Intelligence}

* quick def

* general idea

* common architetures\\
  * FC\\
  * MLP\\
  * CNN\\
  * RNN\\
  * transformers\\

* Machine learning vs Artificial Intelligence vs Deep Learning

* applications

* learning types\\
  * surpervised\\
  * un-supervised\\
  * self-supervised\\
  * reinforcement / semi-supervised\\

* tasks\\
  * classical tasks\\
    * regression\\
    * classification\\
    * partitioning\\
    * dimension reduction\\
  * generative AI\\
    * images => training is difficult\\
    * text\\

* recent progress\\
  * computer vision\\
  * playing games (a way to assess intelligence)\\
  * image generation\\
  * text generation\\
