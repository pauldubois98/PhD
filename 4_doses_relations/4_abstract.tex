Fluence Map Optimization (FMO) requires selecting importance factors for each clinical constraint, which reflect the relative priority of achieving specific dose goals.
These importance factors significantly influence the resulting dose distribution, as varying their values can lead to diverse treatment outcomes.
This chapter investigates the relationship between the chosen importance factors and the resulting dose distributions.
We aim to understand how different configurations affect the trade-offs between conflicting clinical objectives.
This analysis provides insight into optimizing importance factors to achieve the most clinically effective treatment plans.
