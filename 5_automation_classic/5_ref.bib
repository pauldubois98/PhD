	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Automated treatment planning and/or optimization
	systems (ATPS) are in the process of broad clinical
	implementation aiming at reducing inter-planner variability,
	reducing the planning time allocated for the optimization
	process and improving plan quality. Five different ATPS used
	clinically were evaluated for advanced head and neck cancer
	(HNC). METHODS: Three radiation oncology departments compared 5
	different ATPS: 1) Automatic Interactive Optimizer (AIO) in
	combination with RapidArc (in-house developed and Varian Medical
	Systems); 2) Auto-Planning (AP) (Philips Radiation Oncology
	Systems); 3) RapidPlan version 13.6 (RP1) with HNC model from
	University Hospital A (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA);
	4) RapidPlan version 13.7 (RP2) combined with scripting for
	automated setup of fields with HNC model from University
	Hospital B; 5) Raystation multicriteria optimization algorithm
	version 5 (RS) (Laboratories AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Eight
	randomly selected HNC cases from institution A and 8 from
	institution B were used. PTV coverage, mean and maximum dose to
	the organs at risk and effective planning time were compared.
	Ranking was done based on 3 Gy increments for the parallel
	organs. RESULTS: All planning systems achieved the hard dose
	constraints for the PTVs and serial organs for all patients.
	Overall, AP achieved the best ranking for the parallel organs
	followed by RS, AIO, RP2 and RP1. The oral cavity mean dose was
	the lowest for RS (31.3 $\pm$ 17.6 Gy), followed by AP (33.8
	$\pm$ 17.8 Gy), RP1 (34.1 $\pm$ 16.7 Gy), AIO (36.1 $\pm$ 16.8
	Gy) and RP2 (36.3 $\pm$ 16.2 Gy). The submandibular glands mean
	dose was 33.6 $\pm$ 10.8 Gy (AP), 35.2 $\pm$ 8.4 Gy (AIO), 35.5
	$\pm$ 9.3 Gy (RP2), 36.9 $\pm$ 7.6 Gy (RS) and 38.2 $\pm$ 7.0 Gy
	(RP1). The average effective planning working time was
	substantially different between the five ATPS (in minutes): < 2
	$\pm$ 1 for AIO and RP2, 5 $\pm$ 1 for AP, 15 $\pm$ 2 for RP1
	and 340 $\pm$ 48 for RS, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: All ATPS
	were able to achieve all planning DVH constraints and the
	effective working time was kept bellow 20 min for each ATPS
	except for RS. For the parallel organs, AP performed the best,
	although the differences were small.},
