AAPM TG 119 proposes a set of test clinical cases for testing the accuracy of IMRT planning and delivery system. For these test cases, we generated two treatment plans, the first plan using 7–9 static dMLC IMRT fields and a second plan utilizing one- or two-arc VMAT technique. Dose optimization and calculations performed using 6 MV photons and Eclipse treatment planning system. Dose prescription and planning objectives were set according to the TG 119 goals. Plans were scored based on TG 119 planning objectives. Treatment plans were compared using conformity index (CI) for reference dose and homogeneity index (HI) (for ). F or test cases prostate, head-and-neck, C-shape and multitarget prescription dose are 75.6 Gy, 50.4 Gy, 50 Gy and 50 Gy, respectively. VMAT dose distributions were comparable to dMLC IMRT plans. Our planning results matched TG 119 planning results. For treatment plans studied, conformity indices ranged from 1.05–1.23 (IMRT) and 1.04–1.23 (VMAT). Homogeneity indices ranged from 4.6\%–11.0\% (IMRT) and 4.6\%–10.5\% (VMAT). The ratio of total monitor units necessary for dMLC IMRT to that of VMAT was in the range of 1.1–2.0. AAPM TG 119 test cases are useful to generate VMAT benchmark plans. At preclinical implementation stage, plan comparison of VMAT and IMRT plans of AAPM TG 119 test case allowed us to understand basic capabilities of VMAT technique. PACS number: 87.55.Qr},

	abstract = {Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) represents one of the most significant technical advances in radiation therapy since the advent of the medical linear accelerator. It allows the clinical implementation of highly conformal nonconvex dose distributions. This complex but promising treatment modality is rapidly proliferating in both academic and community practice settings. However, these advances do not come without a risk. IMRT is not just an add-on to the current radiation therapy process; it represents a new paradigm that requires the knowledge of multimodality imaging, setup uncertainties and internal organ motion, tumor control probabilities, normal tissue complication probabilities, three-dimensional (3-D) dose calculation and optimization, and dynamic beam delivery of nonuniform beam intensities. Therefore, the purpose of this report is to guide and assist the clinical medical physicist in developing and implementing a viable and safe IMRT program. The scope of the IMRT program is quite broad, encompassing multileaf-collimator-based IMRT delivery systems, goal-based inverse treatment planning, and clinical implementation of IMRT with patient-specific quality assurance. This report, while not prescribing specific procedures, provides the framework and guidance to allow clinical radiation oncology physicists to make judicious decisions in implementing a safe and efficient IMRT program in their clinics.},

	abstract = {Purpose
	To compare heart and coronary artery radiation exposure using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) vs. four-field three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) treatment plans for patients with distal esophageal cancer undergoing chemoradiation.
	Methods and Materials
	Nineteen patients with distal esophageal cancers treated with IMRT from March 2007 to May 2008 were identified. All patients were treated to 50.4 Gy with five-field IMRT plans. Theoretical 3D-CRT plans with four-field beam arrangements were generated. Dose–volume histograms of the planning target volume, heart, right coronary artery, left coronary artery, and other critical normal tissues were compared between the IMRT and 3D-CRT plans, and selected parameters were statistically evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
	Results
	Intensity-modulated radiotherapy treatment planning showed significant reduction (p < 0.05) in heart dose over 3D-CRT as assessed by average mean dose (22.9 vs. 28.2 Gy) and V30 (24.8% vs. 61.0%). There was also significant sparing of the right coronary artery (average mean dose, 23.8 Gy vs. 35.5 Gy), whereas the left coronary artery showed no significant improvement (mean dose, 11.2 Gy vs. 9.2 Gy), p = 0.11. There was no significant difference in percentage of total lung volume receiving at least 10, 15, or 20 Gy or in the mean lung dose between the planning methods. There were also no significant differences observed for the kidneys, liver, stomach, or spinal cord. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy achieved a significant improvement in target conformity as measured by the conformality index (ratio of total volume receiving 95% of prescription dose to planning target volume receiving 95% of prescription dose), with the mean conformality index reduced from 1.56 to 1.30 using IMRT.
	Conclusions
	Treatment of patients with distal esophageal cancer using IMRT significantly decreases the exposure of the heart and right coronary artery when compared with 3D-CRT. Long-term studies are necessary to determine how this will impact on development of coronary artery disease and other cardiac complications.}

	keywords = {Volumetric modulated arc therapy, Prostate cancer, Radiotherapy, Intensity-modulated radiotherapy},
	abstract = {Purpose
	Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is a novel form of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) optimization that allows the radiation dose to be delivered in a single gantry rotation of up to 360°, using either a constant dose rate (cdr-VMAT) or variable dose rate (vdr-VMAT) during rotation. The goal of this study was to compare VMAT prostate RT plans with three-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT) and IMRT plans.
	Patients and Methods
	The 3D-CRT, five-field IMRT, cdr-VMAT, and vdr-VMAT RT plans were created for 10 computed tomography data sets from patients undergoing RT for prostate cancer. The parameters evaluated included the doses to organs at risk, equivalent uniform doses, dose homogeneity and conformality, and monitor units required for delivery of a 2-Gy fraction.
	Results
	The IMRT and both VMAT techniques resulted in lower doses to normal critical structures than 3D-CRT plans for nearly all dosimetric endpoints analyzed. The lowest doses to organs at risk and most favorable equivalent uniform doses were achieved with vdr-VMAT, which was significantly better than IMRT for the rectal and femoral head dosimetric endpoints (p < 0.05) and significantly better than cdr-VMAT for most bladder and rectal endpoints (p < 0.05). The vdr-VMAT and cdr-VMAT plans required fewer monitor units than did the IMRT plans (relative reduction of 42% and 38%, respectively; p = 0.005) but more than for the 3D-CRT plans (p = 0.005).
	Conclusion
	The IMRT and VMAT techniques achieved highly conformal treatment plans. The vdr-VMAT technique resulted in more favorable dose distributions than the IMRT or cdr-VMAT techniques, and reduced the monitor units required compared with IMRT.}

	abstract = {The use of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) has now become common practice in radiation oncology departments around the world. Using beam's eye viewing of volumes defined on a treatment planning computed tomography scan, beam directions and beam shapes can be selected to conform to the shape of the projected target and minimize dose to critical normal structures. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can yield dose distributions that conform closely to the three-dimensional shape of the target volume while still minimizing dose to normal structures by allowing the beam intensity to vary across those shaped fields. Predicted dose distributions for patients with tumors of the prostate, nasopharynx, and paraspinal region are compared between plans made with 3DCRT programs and those with inverse-planned IMRT programs. The IMRT plans are calculated for either static or dynamic beam delivery methods using multileaf collimators. Results of these comparisons indicate that IMRT can yield significantly better dose distributions in some situations at the expense of additional time and resources. New technologies are being developed that should significantly reduce the time needed to plan, implement, and verify these treatments. Current research should help define the future role of IMRT in clinical practice.}

Conformal avoidance of normal tissues goes hand in hand with this. Inhomogeneous dose painting is possible. The technique has become a clinical reality and is likely to be the dominant approach this decade for improving the clinical practice of photon therapy. This Series will explore all aspects of the “IMRT chain”. Only 15 years ago just a handful of physicists were working on this subject. IMRT has developed so rapidly that its recent past is also its ancient history. This article will review the history of IMRT with just a glance at precursors. The physical basis of IMRT is then described including an attempt to introduce the concepts of convex and concave dose distributions, ill-conditioning, inverse-problem degeneracy, cost functions and complex solutions all with a minimum of technical jargon or mathematics. The many techniques for inverse planning are described and the review concludes with a look forward to the future of image-guided IMRT (IG-IMRT).}

	journal = {Physics in Medicine and Biology},
	abstract = {The relationship between rectal dose distribution and the incidence of late rectal complications following external-beam radiotherapy has been previously studied using dose-volume histograms or dose-surface histograms. However, they do not account for the spatial dose distribution. This study proposes a metric based on both surface dose and distance that can predict the incidence of rectal bleeding in prostate cancer patients treated with radical radiotherapy. One hundred and forty-four patients treated with radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer were prospectively followed to record the incidence of grade ≥2 rectal bleeding. Radiotherapy plans were used to evaluate a dose-distance metric that accounts for the dose and its spatial distribution on the rectal surface, characterized by a logistic weighting function with slope a and inflection point d0. This was compared to the effective dose obtained from dose-surface histograms, characterized by the parameter n which describes sensitivity to hot spots. The log-rank test was used to determine statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) cut-off values for the dose-distance metric and effective dose that predict for the occurrence of rectal bleeding. For the dose-distance metric, only d0 = 25 and 30 mm combined with a &gt; 5 led to statistical significant cut-offs. For the effective dose metric, only values of n in the range 0.07–0.35 led to statistically significant cut-offs. The proposed dose-distance metric is a predictor of rectal bleeding in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. Both the dose-distance metric and the effective dose metric indicate that the incidence of grade ≥2 rectal bleeding is sensitive to localized damage to the rectal surface.}

	abstract = {We introduce two new related metrics, the geodesic width and the link width, for measuring the “distance” between two nonintersecting polylines in the plane. If the two polylines have n vertices in total, we present algorithms to compute the geodesic width of the two polylines in O(n2 log n) time using O(n2) space and the link width in O(n3 log n) time using O(n2) working space where n is the total number of edges of the polylines. Our computation of these metrics relies on two closely related combinatorial strutures: the shortest-path diagram and the link diagram of a simple polygon. The shortest-path (resp., link) diagram encodes the Euclidean (resp., link) shortest path distance between all pairs of points on the boundary of the polygon. We use these algorithms to solve two problems:Compute a continuous transformation that “morphs” one polyline into another polyline. Our morphing strategies ensure that each point on a polyline moves as little as necessary during the morphing, that every intermediate polyline is also simple and disjoint to any other intermediate polyline, and that no portion of the polylines to be morphed is stretched or compressed by more than a user-defined parameter during the entire morphing. We present an algorithm that computes the geodesic width of the two polylines and utilizes it to construct a corresponding morphing strategy in O(n2 log2n) time using O(n2) space. We also give an O(nlog n) time algorithm to compute a 2-approximation of the geodesic width and a corresponding morphing scheme.Locate a continuously moving target using a group of guards moving inside a simple polygon. The guards always determine a simple polygonal chain within the polygon, with consecutive guards along the chain being mutually visible. We compute a strategy that sweeps such a chain of guards through the polygon in order to locate a target. We compute in O(n3) time and O(n2) working space the minimum number r* of guards needed to sweep an n-vertex polygon. We also give an approximation algorithm, using O(n log n) time and O(n) space, to compute an integer r such that max(r - 16, 2) ≤ r*≤ r and P can be swept with a chain of r guards.}

The derived analytical bound of the maximum deviation can be used as a natural bench mark for the line fitting algorithms and thus dominant point detection methods can be made parameter-independent and non-heuristic. Most methods can easily incorporate the bound. This is demonstrated using three categorically different dominant point detection methods. Such non-parametric approach retains the characteristics of the digital curve while providing good fitting performance and compression ratio for all the three methods using a variety of digital, non-digital, and noisy curves.}
