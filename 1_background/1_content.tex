\section{Medical context}
% what is cancer
% beyond the cellular level, impacting tissues
\subsection{10 cancer markers}
\begin{itemize}
	\item cell proliferation
	\item reprogram cellular metabolism
	\item stop cell growth arrest
	\item evade apoptosis
	\item escape immune system
	\item ability to undergo a sufficient number of successive cell cycles of growth and division to generate macroscopic tumors
	\item create new blog vessels to get nutriments
	\item allow cell escape and metastasis formation
	\item change cellular response phenotypic via plasticity
	\item senescence
\end{itemize}

\subsection{4 cancer conditions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item mutation
	\item epigenetic reprogramming
	\item inflammatory context
	\item disruption of microbiota
\end{itemize}
% => on what does RT applies?

\subsection{phases of cancer}
\paragraph{initiation}
\paragraph{promotion}
\paragraph{tumorigenesis + neoangiogenesis}
\paragraph{evolution (local, regional, metastasis)}
% => at what stage does RT applies?

\subsection{cancer classification:}
\paragraph{tumor, node, mestastasis}
% => at what stage does RT applies?
\paragraph{stages classification:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item stage 0 which corresponds to a so-called in situ tumor
	\item stage 1 which corresponds to a single, small tumor
	\item stage 2 which corresponds to a larger local volume
	\item stage 3 which corresponds to invasion of the lymph nodes or surrounding tissues
	\item stage 4 which corresponds to a wider extension in the body in the form of metastases
\end{enumerate}
% => at what stage does RT applies?
