	abstract = {Abstract Past patterns of cancer disease and future changes in the demographic structure have a major influence on the projected incidences of human malignancies. In Germany, nearly a quarter of men and 20\% of women die of cancer, and it is estimated that in Germany around 51\% men and 43\% women will develop cancer during lifetime. Here, we project the cancer incidence case number as well as the number of deaths for the most common cancers in the German population for the years 2020 and 2030. By 2030, prostate cancer will be the most common malignancy, surpassing breast cancer. Lung cancer will rank third most frequent cancer and will remain the most common cause of cancer-related mortality. Additionally, our projections show a marked increase in liver cancer cases with a continuous rise in liver cancer-related deaths. Finally, we project a constant increase in the incidence of pancreatic cancer. Based on our projections, pancreatic cancer will surpass colorectal and breast cancer to rank as the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in Germany by 2030.},

	abstract = {Advocates for “personalized medicine” tests claim they can reduce health care spending by identifying patients unlikely to benefit from costly treatments. But most tests are imperfect, and so physicians have considerable discretion in how they use the results. We show that when physicians face incentives to provide a treatment, the introduction of an imperfect prognostic test will increase treatment rates. We study the interaction of incentives and information in physicians’ choice between conventional radiotherapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for Medicare patients with breast cancer. IMRT is far more costly. Patients with left-side tumors are more likely to benefit from IMRT, though it is unnecessary for the vast majority of patients. IMRT use is 18 percentage points higher in freestanding clinics, where physician-owners share in the lucrative fees generated by IMRT, than in hospital-based clinics. Patients with left-side tumors are more likely to receive IMRT in both types of clinics. However, IMRT use in patients with right-side tumors (the low benefit group) treated in freestanding clinics is actually higher than use in patients with left-side tumors (high benefit group) treated in hospital-based clinics. Prognostic information affects use but does nothing to counter incentives to overuse IMRT.},

	abstract={In the field of radiotherapy, there is very little scientific data on the management of nonagenarians, especially in patients aged 90 years or more and with head and neck cancer (HNC). We made one of the first retrospective study of the feasibility and safety of radiotherapy in this population with HNC. Records of radiotherapy coming from four health facilities were studied to include all nonagenarian patients with HNC in the last 10 years and who received radiation therapy. We analyzed patient characteristics and primary cancers, as well as objective of the treatment (curative or palliative), efficacy and toxicity. Twenty patients receiving radiotherapy were identified; mean age was 93.2 years (standard deviation 2.8). Treatment was given with curative and palliative intent in 40 and 60 {\%} of cases, respectively. The most common primary tumors were tumors of the salivary glands (30 {\%} of cases), oral cavity tumors (25 {\%} of cases) and thyroid tumors (15 {\%} of cases). Median total prescribed dose was 47.5 Gy (12--70 Gy). Median number of delivered fractions was 18.5 (2--35 fractions). All patients received intensive supportive care during radiotherapy. Toxicities were mild to moderate. Radiotherapy could not be completed for four patients (20 {\%} of cases). One patient developed grade 1--2 delayed toxicities. At the last follow-up, only four patients (20 {\%} of cases) were alive. Cancer was cause of death in most cases. Radiotherapy may be performed for the nonagenarians with HNC. The total dose and fractionation must be adjusted to optimize the tolerance. However, the prognosis remains very poor, cancer being the main cause of death. Research of geriatric vulnerabilities prior to any treatment, in the context of a comprehensive geriatric assessment, is still recommended to select patients for radiotherapy.},

	abstract = {Radiotherapy is an important cornerstone in cancer treatment. Ionizing gamma-irradiation is capable of inducing DNA damage and consequential cell death in a precise and effective manner. In recent years it has become clear, however, that this is not the only relevant mechanism of action. Radiotherapy alters the immune composition of the tumor and influences upregulation of MHC I and cancer-testis antigens, inducing immunogenic cell death and supporting dendritic cell activation. Paradoxically, it also increases the relative ratio of regulatory T cells to CD4+ cells, which hampers an effective immune response. Nevertheless, the overall stimulating influence of irradiation on the immune system has been recognized and illustrated in preclinical studies as well as clinical case reports. There have been several attempts to use radiotherapy as an in situ vaccine. The basic rationale is a synergistic effect of different immune therapies like dendritic cell vaccination and CTLA-4 blockade with irradiation. Changes in the immune phenotype after radiotherapy can facilitate dendritic cell functioning. Immune therapy is also able to overcome the inhibitory pool of regulatory T cells through CTLA-4 inhibition, a weak point of radiotherapy. Although successful in preclinical models, there is still a lot of ground that needs to be covered. The optimal radiation dose is crucial, as well as timing and patient selection. Once these unknown parameters are explored, there is a lot of potential in the powerful combination of local immunization and systemic immune treatments for future novel cancer regimens.},

The cataloging of the -omic determinants of radiation sensitivity of cancer has great potential in enhancing efficacy and limiting toxicity in the context of a new approach to precision radiotherapy. Herein, we review concepts and data that contribute to the delineation of the radiogenomic landscape of cancer.}

	abstract = {The IMRT treatment planning process typically follows a path that is based on the manner in which the planner interactively adjusts the target and organ-at-risk (OAR) constraints and priorities. The time-intensive nature of this process restricts the planner from fully understanding the dose trade-off between structures, making it unlikely that the resulting plan fully exploits the extent to which dose can be redistributed between anatomical structures. Multiobjective Pareto optimization has been used in the past to enable the planner to more thoroughly explore alternatives in dose trade-off by combining pre-generated Pareto optimal solutions in real time, thereby potentially tailoring a plan more exactly to requirements. However, generating the Pareto optimal solutions can be nonintuitive and computationally time intensive. The author presents an intuitive and fast non-Pareto approach for generating optimization sequences (prior to planning), which can then be rapidly combined by the planner in real time to yield a satisfactory plan. Each optimization sequence incrementally reduces dose to one OAR at a time, starting from the optimization solution where dose to all OARs are reduced with equal priority, until user-specified target coverage limits are violated. The sequences are computationally efficient to generate, since the optimization at each position along a sequence is initiated from the end result of the previous position in the sequence. The pre-generated optimization sequences require no user interaction. In real time, a planner can more or less instantaneously visualize a treatment plan by combining the dose distributions corresponding to user-selected positions along each of the optimization sequences (target coverage is intrinsically maintained in the combination). Interactively varying the selected positions along each of the sequences enables the planner to rapidly understand the nature of dose trade-off between structures and, thereby, arrive at a suitable plan in a short time. This methodology is demonstrated on a prostate cancer case and olfactory neuroblastoma case.},

	abstract = "{Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a widely accepted method for radiation treatment to provide a prescribed and uniform dose to the target volume and a minimum dose to normal tissues that is dependent on the IMRT software and the treatment machine. We examined the variation in IMRT dose prescription, treatment planning, dose recording, and dose delivery among cancer patients who were treated with different treatment planning systems at different medical institutions to assess variability in patient care.We conducted a retrospective analysis of 803 patients who were treated with IMRT between October 2004 and July 2006 for brain, head and neck, or prostate cancer at five medical institutions that used different treatment planning systems. The prescribed dose to the target volume, as recorded in the chart or as noted in the electronic data management system, was extracted for each patient. The planned dose that was delivered to the patient, as represented in the dose–volume histogram, was acquired from each treatment planning system. The actual minimum, maximum, median, and isocenter doses to the target volume were normalized to the prescribed dose and analyzed for each disease site and institution.Of the 803 patients, 12\% were treated for brain cancer, 26\% for head and neck cancer, and 62\% for prostate cancer. The recorded dose variability from prescription was widespread for the minimum, maximum, and isocenter doses. A total of 46\% of the patients received a maximum dose that was more than 10\% higher than the prescribed dose, and 63\% of the patients received a dose that was more than 10\% lower than the prescribed dose. At all five institutions, the prostate cancer cases had the smallest dosimetric variation and the head and neck cancer cases had the largest variation. The median dose to the target varied from the prescribed dose by ±2\% in 68\% of the patients, by ±5\% in 88\% of the patients, and by ±10\% in 96\% of the patients. The recorded isocenter dose varied from prescription for all disease sites and treatment planning systems.Substantial variation in the prescribed and delivered doses exists among medical institutions, raising concerns about the validity of comparing clinical outcomes for IMRT. The isocenter dose in IMRT is simply a point dose and often does not reflect the prescription dose that is specified by a selected isodose line encompassing the target volume. This study suggests the need for national and/or international guidelines for dose prescription, planning, and reporting for a meaningful clinical trial in IMRT.}",

Three Australian radiotherapy centres, each with a different planning system, were supplied a fully contoured CT dataset and requested to generate an IMRT plan in accordance with the requirements of an IMRT-based radiation therapy oncology group clinical trial. Plan analysis was carried out using software developed specifically for reviewing multicentre clinical trial data. Two out of the three plans failed to meet the prescription requirements with one misinterpreting the prescription and the third failed to meet one of the constraints. Only one plan achieved all of the dose objectives for the critical structures and normal tissues. Although each centre used very similar planning parameters and beam arrangements the resulting plans were quite different. The subjective interpretation and application of the prescription and planning objectives emphasize one of the many difficulties in carrying out multicentre IMRT planning studies. The treatment prescription protocol in a clinical trial must be both lucid and unequivocally stated to avoid misinterpretation. Australian radiotherapy centres must show that they can produce a quality IMRT plan and that they can adhere to protocols for IMRT planning before using it in a clinical trial.},
